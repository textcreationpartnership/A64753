         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>He was the <hi>eldeſt Son</hi> of <hi>Edward Vaughan</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>born</hi> on the Fourteenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1603.
<pb facs="tcp:99478:4"/> at <hi>Trowſcoed</hi> in the County of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> the <hi>Ancient Seat</hi> of his <hi>Family,</hi> himſelf being the Eleventh of that <hi>Houſe</hi> in a direct Line.</p>
            <p>About the Tenth year of his <hi>Age</hi> he was ſent to be <hi>Educated</hi> at a <hi>Publique School</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and about the Fifteenth removed from thence to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> where, although he had a <hi>Tutor</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Colledge,</hi> yet the <hi>Education</hi> of him was more eſpecially committed to an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> of his own by his <hi>Fathers</hi> ſide, then a <hi>Fellow</hi> of <hi>All-Souls Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who being a <hi>perſon</hi> of <hi>good Learning</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> omitted nothing that might <hi>cheriſh</hi> the <hi>hopes</hi> he entertain'd of his <hi>Nephew,</hi> and improve him in all <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Learning</hi> with which the <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles</hi> he would frequently commemorate to his Laſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99478:5"/>
            <p>About the Eighteenth year of his <hi>Age</hi> he was removed to <hi>London,</hi> and on the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> in the Year 1621. admitted of the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> where I have often heard him ſay, that he addicted himſelf to <hi>Poetry, Mathematicks,</hi> and ſuch more <hi>alluring Studies</hi> at firſt, neglecting that <hi>ſeverer</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> until he became acquainted with that <hi>incomparable Perſon</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>J. Selden,</hi> who diſcerning in him a <hi>ready Wit,</hi> and <hi>ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> did ſtudiouſly afford him <hi>Occaſion</hi> of making a right uſe of two ſuch <hi>excellent Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,</hi> and frequently admitted him to the Converſe of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and other <hi>worthy Perſons</hi> his <hi>Cotemporaries,</hi> where having been <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> in the value of <hi>Civil Learning,</hi> he ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apply'd himſelf cloſely to that Courſe of <hi>Study,</hi> and more particularly of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which he after made his <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99478:5"/> His <hi>Practice,</hi> after he was call'd to the <hi>Bar,</hi> was for the moſt part in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> where he ſoon became Eminent.</p>
            <p>He was elected <hi>Burgeſs</hi> for the <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> to ſerve in the <hi>Parliament</hi> Conven'd on the Third of <hi>November,</hi> 1640. where he gave ſufficient Teſtimony his <hi>Learning</hi> was not confin'd within the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Westminſter-Hall,</hi> but that he was poſſeſs'd of great <hi>Publique A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi> likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Soon after King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt withdrew from <hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and that the <hi>Rent</hi> between Him and the <hi>Parliament</hi> was too too viſible, being no longer able to ſerve his <hi>Prince</hi> there, he left the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> (whence he, among other <hi>Worthy Members,</hi> was not long after <hi>Secluded</hi> by <hi>Vote</hi> of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> and a <hi>new Writ</hi> iſſued forth for
<pb facs="tcp:99478:6"/> the <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Member</hi> in his place) and he betook himſelf to thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was capable of ſerving his <hi>Prince</hi> in his <hi>proper County.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Year 1641. in which he retir'd from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> until the Year 1660. in which God bleſſed us with the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of our <hi>preſent King,</hi> he did in a manner quit his <hi>Profeſſion:</hi> For in that time he never received a <hi>Fee</hi> from any Perſon whatever, nor could be prevail'd with to appear in any <hi>Court,</hi> although exceedingly importun'd to it by ſuch as had a deſire to make uſe of his <hi>Abilities:</hi> And the reaſon I have heard him aſſign for it, was, <hi>That it was the Duty of an honeſt Man to decline, as far as in him lay, owning Juriſdictions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Authority from any Power, but their lawful Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99478:6"/>
            <p>Private Counſel he frequently imparted, but that was either <hi>gratuitouſly</hi> to ſuch of his <hi>Acquaintance</hi> as he had a great <hi>Eſteem</hi> for, or <hi>charitably</hi> to ſuch as were not at all, or not well able, to <hi>Fee</hi> other <hi>Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus for the moſt part for Twenty years together, he paſs'd a retir'd Life at his <hi>own Country Houſe,</hi> until he was Elected to ſerve as <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Shire</hi> for the County of <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> in this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> begun the Eighth Day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1661. and on the Twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> 1668. his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> whoſe <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is ever Extenſive to <hi>worthy Men,</hi> did by his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> conſtitute him <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> in which <hi>Imployment</hi> he died on the Tenth of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year 1674. Leaving theſe <hi>Remains</hi> of his <hi>Labours</hi> in that <hi>Court,</hi> which having no particular <hi>Direction</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99478:7"/> from the <hi>Author</hi> to that purpoſe, I did for ſome time reſolve ſhould not have been made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, although I well underſtood the value of ſome of them, wherein there are <hi>Queſtions</hi> handled, not familiar in any of our <hi>Reports</hi> yet extant; but in their Nature more Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Reſolve</hi> of mine being imparted to ſome <hi>Learned Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Coyf,</hi> and others who had a particular eſteem for the <hi>Author,</hi> begot <hi>Importunities</hi> for <hi>Copies</hi> of ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> then in my hands, which were procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſoon after, by what means I know not, diſperſed further than I intended them, and as I have been informed, Cited as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having, without my privity, become ſo Publique, and apprehending that things in
<pb facs="tcp:99478:7"/> themſelves <hi>good, innocent,</hi> and <hi>uſeful,</hi> may by miſ-application become dangerous, and diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I conceived it beſt to procure a <hi>Licence</hi> for them to ſpeak for themſelves, that they may bear their own blame, and that ſuch as make uſe of them may have no further ſhare in the Guilt (if any ſuch be) than that they have, done as others do, that is, <hi>Quoted Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which I conceive may be done with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; moſt of the ſubſequent <hi>Caſes</hi> being not the <hi>ſingle Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> but the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of the <hi>whole Court</hi> by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. If in ſome few other <hi>Caſes</hi> it hath been his Fate in any thing to differ from his <hi>Brethren,</hi> it is no more than many of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors</hi> have done; particularly that moſt <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Reverend Judge,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart,</hi> whoſe <hi>ſingle Opinions</hi> in many <hi>Caſes</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, being built upon <hi>excellent Reaſon,</hi> carry

               <p>That the <hi>Law</hi> is clear, the Plaintiff in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> muſt in his <hi>Count</hi> alledg a <hi>Preſentation</hi> in himſelf, or thoſe from whom he claims, and that therefore the Defendant ſhould likewiſe ſo do.</p>
               <p>But in this Caſe the <hi>Defendant</hi> in his <hi>Plea</hi> hath alledged no Preſentation in any from whom he claims, or in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond cauſe of <hi>Demurrer</hi> inſiſted on, is, That the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hath by his Plea <hi>traverſed</hi> the <hi>appendency</hi> alledged in the Plaintiffs <hi>Count</hi> of the <hi>third part</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> of <hi>Burton Baſſet</hi> to the third part of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> and <hi>third part of the Rectory of Burton Baſſet,</hi> whereas he ought to have <hi>travers'd</hi> the <hi>Preſentation alledged</hi> by the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in the Lord <hi>Wootton,</hi> by whom the Plaintiff claims, and not the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: And divers <hi>Authorities</hi> have been pretended, that ſo is the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> As to the firſt cauſe of <hi>Demurrer:</hi> It is true, that in a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Impedit</hi> both <hi>Plaintiff</hi> and <hi>Defendant</hi> may be <hi>Actors,</hi> and either have a Writ to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as the right falls out to be.</p>
               <p>But it is not true, that both are always <hi>Actors</hi> in a <hi>Quare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit:</hi> For if the <hi>Defendant</hi> hath preſented his <hi>Clerk,</hi> and he be <hi>admitted, inſtituted</hi> and <hi>inducted</hi> before the <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought, the Defendant hath then no cauſe to have a Writ to the Biſhop for the doing of that which is already done; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in ſuch Caſe the Defendant is no <hi>Actor</hi> but a bare <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a man hath preſented, and his <hi>Clerk</hi> is <hi>inſtituted,</hi> and <hi>inducted,</hi> he is at the end of his work, and hath no more to do than to keep what he hath gotten; for thereby he hath a full <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi> which is Title ſufficient, if there be not a better.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> who is to recover that which he hath not, muſt ſhew a good Title before he can recover, or he ſhall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Defendants poſſeſſion by ſhewing no <hi>Title,</hi> or an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, which is the ſame with none.</p>
               <p>It can be neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Common Reaſon</hi> for the Plaintiff to tell the Defendant, you have no good Title, and thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore I have.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99478:13"/>
               <p>The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> muſt recover if at all by his own ſtrength, and not by the <hi>Defendants weakneſs,</hi> as is well urg'd and clear'd in <hi>Digbies</hi> and <hi>Fitzherberts Caſe in the Lord Hobart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Defendant hath alledged in his Plea a <hi>Title pro forma,</hi> and that he hath preſented by reaſon thereof, and that his <hi>Clerk</hi> is <hi>inſtituted</hi> and <hi>inducted,</hi> which is ſufficient for the preſent and future time, if no better <hi>Title</hi> be oppos'd to it, without alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any other Preſentation in himſelf, or any from whom he claims.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Defendant</hi> were out of poſſeſſion, as the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> is, he muſt then make out a good <hi>Title,</hi> as the Plaintiff now muſt, or elſe the Defendant ſhould never have a Writ to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to admit his Clerk; and in ſuch Caſe only it holde true, <hi>That the Defendant is Actor as well as the Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in ſuch Caſe he is to alledg a Seiſin of the <hi>Advowſon,</hi> as the Plaintiff muſt in himſelf, or thoſe from whom he claims, which can never be done without alledging a former <hi>Preſentation,</hi> that being the only actual <hi>Seiſin</hi> of an <hi>Advowſon;</hi> for the cauſe, why he ſhould preſent to the preſent vacancy.</p>
               <p>So as the not alledging a former Preſentation will be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Defendants Title,</hi> beſides the Plaintiff hath alledg'd a Preſentation both in his Anceſſor <hi>Sir Thomas Temple</hi> of <hi>Reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalds,</hi> and in himſelf of <hi>Manfell</hi> for him, but I make no account of that, for if the Defendant will take advantage of a <hi>Title</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him by the Plaintiff, he muſt take it as the Plaintiff gives it, which in this Caſe the Defendant doth not.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> by his <hi>Count</hi> makes the Defendants <hi>Anceſtor</hi> and himſelf ſeis'd in their Demeſne, as of <hi>Fee,</hi> of <hi>2 Parts of 3</hi> of the <hi>Mannor of Burton Baſſet,</hi> and of a third part of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> of <hi>Burton Baſſet,</hi> as appendant to the ſaid <hi>2 Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Defendant</hi> by his Plea ſaith he was ſeiſed in Fee of <hi>2 Parts of 3</hi> of the ſaid Mannor, and of the intire <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the <hi>Vicaridge,</hi> as appendant to the ſame <hi>2 parts,</hi> and ſo preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is another <hi>Title</hi> than that admitted by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> For the <hi>2</hi> cauſe of Demurrer, which is a point of more difficulty, I take it for Law, and ſhall accordingly prove it, <hi>That when the Defendant traverſeth any part of the Plaintiffs Count or Declaration in a Quare Impedit, it ought to be ſuch part, as is both inconſiſtent with the Defendants Title, and being found againſt the Plaintiff doth abſolutely deſtroy his Title,</hi> for if it doth not ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inconſiſtent it be with the <hi>Defendants Title,</hi> the <hi>Traverſe</hi> is not well taken.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99478:13"/>
               <p>To prove this I ſhall make uſe of <hi>2 Caſes</hi> urg'd at the <hi>Bar</hi> for the Plaintiff: but rightly underſtood, are fully againſt him.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>10 H. 7. f. 27.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">10 H. 7. f. 27.</note> in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> the Plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he preſented ſuch a one his Clerk, who was <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, inſtituted</hi> and <hi>inducted,</hi> and after the <hi>Church</hi> became void, and he ought to preſent, the Defendant pleaded his Anceſtor was ſeis'd of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> to which the <hi>Advowſon</hi> was appendant, and <hi>preſented,</hi> and that the <hi>Mannor</hi> deſcended to him, and that the Church being void, he preſented and traverſed, <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that the <hi>Advowſon</hi> is in groſs.</p>
               <p>It was adjudged, that the Defendant ought to have traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Preſentation,</hi> and not the <hi>Seiſin</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon in groſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it was inferr'd, that in the preſent Caſe the <hi>Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> alledg'd ought by like reaſon to have been traverſed, and not the appendency, for <hi>traverſing,</hi> the appendency in this Caſe differs not from <hi>traverſing the Seiſin in groſs</hi> in that Caſe.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon of that Iudgment, when rightly underſtood, is very clear.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in the <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> (as the Caſe appears in the book) did not declare, that he was ſeis'd of the Advowſon in groſs, and preſented (though perhaps if the Original Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration did appear, it might be he did ſo declare) but declares, that he preſented, and his Clerk was admitted, inſtituted and inducted, and the Church becoming void, it belong'd to him to preſent again.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon, be alledging no <hi>Seiſin in groſs</hi> of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon,</hi> but only his <hi>Preſentation,</hi> and that his <hi>Clerk</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Defendant formally ought to have traverſed the <hi>Preſentation,</hi> which was alledg'd, and not the <hi>Seiſin in groſs</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon,</hi> which was not alledged.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe is the ſame, whether he did, or did not, alledg in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> that he was ſeis'd of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> in groſs and preſented.</p>
               <p>For ſtill the Plaintiffs Preſentation was to be traverſed by the Defendant, and not his being ſeis'd in <hi>groſs,</hi> though it were true, that the Defendant, making <hi>Title by the appendency</hi> of the Advowſon to his <hi>Mannor,</hi> the Plaintiffs <hi>Seiſin</hi> in groſs was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconſiſtent with the <hi>appendency,</hi> and therefore ſpeciouſly to be traverſed by the Defendant.</p>
               <p>But that traverſe left a Title in the Plaintiff not deſtroyed, and therefore was not good.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99478:14"/>
               <p>For whether the Plaintiff were ſeiſed or not of the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in groſs, he preſenting in the vacancy, and his Clerk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted, inſtituted and inducted, he thereby gained a good <hi>Title</hi> by Vſurpation to preſent, when the Church became next void.</p>
               <p>And that is the true reaſon in that Caſe, why the preſentation which made the Plaintiffs immediate <hi>Title</hi> to preſent again, was to be traverſed, and not his Seiſin in groſs of the Advowſon, which was not material, when his Vſurpation gave him a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, though he were not ſeis'd in groſs before his Vſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ander. 1 Part f. 296. p. 276.</note>The next Caſe I ſhall uſe is as good authority out of the <hi>new Books</hi> as the other was out of the old. It is the <hi>Lord Buckhurſts</hi> Caſe reported <hi>in the firſt part of the L. Anderſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>L. Buckhurſt</hi> brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter and T. Bickley</hi> for diſturbing him to preſent to the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> of <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> and declared that the <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> appertain'd to the <hi>Rectory of Weſtfield,</hi> whereof he was ſeiſed in Fee, and preſented <hi>Maurice Sackvil</hi> his Clerk, who was thereto admitted, inſtituted and inducted, that the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> was a <hi>Vicaridge</hi> with Cure of the annual value of <hi>8 l. </hi> And that the ſaid <hi>Sackvil</hi> accepted another <hi>Benefice</hi> with Cure, by reaſon whereof, and of the Statute of <hi>21 H. 8.</hi> the <hi>Vicaridge</hi> became void, and he preſented and was diſturbed by the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhop pleaded,</hi> that before the Writ purchaſed one <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Biſhop of Chicheſter,</hi> his Predeceſſor, was ſeiſed of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Vicaridge</hi> in Fee as in groſs, and collated to the ſaid Vicaridge being void, one <hi>Maurice Berkley,</hi> who was inducted thereto, and the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> dying, the preſent <hi>Biſhop</hi> was made <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and became ſeiſed of the Advowſon, and the <hi>Church</hi> became void by the ſaid <hi>Sackvil's</hi> taking another <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> with Cure, and he collated the ſaid <hi>Bickley</hi> the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and traverſed <hi>abſque hoc, that the Advowſon of the ſaid Vicaridge pertained to the Rectory of Weſtfield modo &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, as the Plaintiff alledg'd. And Bickley,</hi> the other <hi>Defendant,</hi> pleaded the ſame Plea.</p>
               <p>Vpon theſe Pleas it was <hi>demurred,</hi> becauſe the traverſe to the <hi>Appendency</hi> was not good, as was alledged; and after much Argument, and many Caſes cited, where the Appendency was traverſable.</p>
               <p>The Court reſolved the <hi>appendency</hi> was not traverſable in the Caſe, nor was it material, whether the Advowſon were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99478:14"/> or in groſs, as the <hi>book</hi> is expreſs, ſo as nothing could be traverſable in the Caſe then, but the Lord <hi>Buckhurſts</hi> Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which after the <hi>Induction</hi> of his <hi>Clerk,</hi> though it were by Vſurpation made him a good <hi>Title</hi> to preſent, when the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge became next void.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, that if the Defendant could not <hi>traverſe</hi> the L. <hi>Buckhurſts</hi> Preſentation of <hi>Sackvil,</hi> which was his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Title,</hi> the Defendant was remedileſs, but by a Writ of <hi>Droit d'Advowſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the reſolution of this Caſe of the <hi>L. Buckhuſt,</hi> the Caſe of <hi>10 H. 7.</hi> before cited was principally relyed on, as warranting the Iudgment which it fully doth, it being adjudged for the ſame reaſon there, that the Seiſin in Fee of the Advowſon in groſs was not traverſable, but the Preſentation was, as it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in this Caſe, that the appendency was not traverſable by the Defendant, but the Preſentation.</p>
               <p>And by the way I obſerve,<note place="margin">Hobart. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies Caſe f. 102.</note> that in the Report of the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt's</hi> Caſe it is admitted, that the Plaintiff in the Caſe of <hi>10 H. 7.</hi> did <hi>count,</hi> that he was ſeiſed of the <hi>Advowſon in groſs and preſented,</hi> whereas I noted the Original Caſe in the Book is, that he counted only upon his Preſentation, and probably it was ſo for the reaſons given in <hi>Digbies</hi> Caſe by the Lord <hi>Hobart,</hi> that a bare Preſentment is only militant, when ſo alledged by the Plaintiff, and may be in ſuch a Caſe, as may prove the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to have right of preſenting at the preſent avoidance, if no right be alledged by the Plaintiff, why he ſhould preſent.</p>
               <p>Whence I collect, that in both theſe caſes of <hi>10 H. 7.</hi> and this of the L. <hi>Buckhurſts,</hi> though there were a manifeſt inconſiſtency in the firſt Caſe between the <hi>Plaintiffs Count,</hi> that he was ſeiſed of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> in groſs, and preſented, and the <hi>Defendants Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that he was ſeiſed of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> to which the <hi>Advowſon</hi> was <hi>appendant;</hi> for it was impoſſible it ſhould be <hi>appendant</hi> for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and <hi>in groſs</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the L. <hi>Buckhurſts</hi> Caſe, who counted that he was ſeiſed of the <hi>Rectory of Weſtfield,</hi> to which the <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge belong'd,</hi> and the Defendant made <hi>Title,</hi> that he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the <hi>Advowſon in groſs,</hi> which <hi>Titles</hi> were directly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, yet neither the Seiſin in groſs in the firſt Caſe, nor the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> in the laſt Caſe were traverſable, but the Preſentation of the Plaintiffs in both, which made their immediate <hi>Titles</hi> to preſent at the next <hi>avoidance,</hi> whether there were a Seiſin in groſs, or an <hi>appendency</hi> or not, when they firſt preſented.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99478:15"/>
               <p>As in theſe <hi>2 Caſes</hi> the true reaſon of the Law appears, why the Seiſin in groſs of the <hi>Advowſon,</hi> nor the <hi>appendency</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon alledged</hi> by the Plaintiffs were not traverſable, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Preſentation.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Rone</hi> the preſent <hi>Incumbent</hi> pleaded, that he was Parſon by the Kings Preſentation, and that long before <hi>Southwell</hi> had any thing in the <hi>Mannor Queen Eliz.</hi> was ſeiſed of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> in groſs in right of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and preſented <hi>Snell;</hi> that the <hi>Advowſon</hi> deſcended to King <hi>James</hi> by the death of the <hi>Queen;</hi> and he being ſeiſed, the <hi>Church</hi> becoming void by <hi>Snell's</hi> death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the preſent <hi>Incumbent,</hi> who was inſtituted and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>And <hi>traverſed abſque hoc, that the Advowſon was appendant to the Mannor of Popenho, and thereupon Iſſue was joined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Caſe alſo the <hi>Traverſe</hi> of the <hi>appendency</hi> by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was clearly good, and ſo admitted, for the Plaintiff <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> had no more, nor other <hi>Title</hi> to preſent than by the <hi>appenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> to the <hi>Mannor,</hi> and the <hi>Incumbents</hi> death, and the <hi>appendency</hi> to the <hi>Mannor</hi> was inconſiſtent with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants <hi>Title</hi> by the <hi>Advowſon's</hi> being in <hi>groſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two laſt Caſes fully prove the Rule by me taken, and which will conclude the Caſe in queſtion, <hi>that the Traverſe is well taken to the Appendency of the Advowſon, when it is all the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Title to preſent, and is inconſiſtent with the Defendants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this Caſe of <hi>Gawdys,</hi> the Iury found ſpecially, that <hi>Southwell</hi> was ſeiſed of the <hi>Mannor</hi> with the Advowſon appendant and preſented, and that the Incumbent dying <hi>2 Feb. 1588.</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> the <hi>15th. of Feb.</hi> in the ſame year preſented <hi>Snell</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> then void, <hi>per mortem naturalem ultimi Incumbentis ibidem

               </p>
               <p>And after the death of <hi>Snell,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> preſented <hi>Rone</hi> in theſe words, <hi>ad noſtram praeſentationem, ſive ex pleno jure, ſive per lapſum temporis, ſive alio quocunque modo ſpectantem:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Court, whether the <hi>Advowſon</hi> were appendant to the <hi>Mannor</hi> or not; It was adjudged.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That the <hi>Advowſon</hi> remained appendant notwithſtanding the <hi>Queens Preſentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That her <hi>Preſentation</hi> could not be by <hi>Lapſe,</hi> for her Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Inſtitution and Induction were in the ſame month of <hi>Febr.</hi> wherein the voidance was.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> If the <hi>Queen</hi> had preſented by Lapſe it had made no ſeverance of the <hi>Advowſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> That the <hi>Queens</hi> Preſentation made no Vſurpation, becauſe ſhe preſented, as ſuppoſing ſhe had a Title in right of her <hi>Crown,</hi> as appeared by the form of her Preſentation, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and therefore her Preſentation was meerly void; for it ſhall not be intended, the Queen took away anothers right againſt her own will and declared intention.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> For the ſame reaſon King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Preſentation</hi> of <hi>Rone,</hi> who by the form of his <hi>Preſentation</hi> ſuppoſed he had a good <hi>Title,</hi> when he had none, was alſo void: and this agrees with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in <hi>Greens C. the 6th. Rep.</hi> that the <hi>Queens</hi> Preſentation made as by Lapſe, when ſhe had no ſuch <hi>Title</hi> to preſent by lapſe, but another <hi>Title</hi> either in right of her Crown, or by <hi>Simony,</hi> or ſome other way, was void, becauſe ſhe was miſtaken in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: So if ſhe preſents by reaſon of ſome ſuppoſed <hi>Title</hi> in her Letters of preſentation, when indeed ſhe had no <hi>Title</hi> at all, the Preſentation is meerly void, and though ſuch Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make a plenarty, ſo as to avoid Lapſe, yet the right Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron is not out of poſſeſſion, but may preſent <hi>7 years</hi> after, and if his <hi>Clark</hi> be inducted, the former preſentee is immediately outed.</p>
               <p>Hence it is to be noted as a point very obſervable in this Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>that though the King may preſent by Uſurpation, yet he ſhall never preſent by Uſurpation if in the Letters of Preſentation, he preſent by ſome Title which he hath not; but if he preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, making no Title at all by his Preſentation, and his Clerk be received, and dyes, he hath gained a Title by Uſurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the <hi>King</hi> declare in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> that he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99478:16"/> of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> in groſs, or as <hi>appendant</hi> to a <hi>Mannor</hi> and preſented, if he had preſented before by <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> ſhall not <hi>traverſe</hi> his <hi>Seiſin</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> or <hi>appendency</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>So is it in the Caſe of a <hi>Common Perſon</hi> alſo, as appears in the end of the Caſe, <hi>10 H. 7.</hi> where it is ſaid, It was agreed by the Court, that if the Plaintiff entitle himſelf to an <hi>Advowſon,</hi> as <hi>appendant</hi> to a <hi>Mannor,</hi> and ſheweth a preſentment, as <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant</hi> (for ſo are the words) and the Defendant ſhews another <hi>Preſentment, without that that the Advowſon is appendant,</hi> this <hi>Traverſe</hi> is good, for if it be not appendant, as the <hi>Plaintiff declares,</hi> it is ſufficient to deſtroy his <hi>Declaration;</hi> and ſo there both are traverſable, but otherwiſe, as the Caſe is here, <hi>viz.</hi> the principal Caſe firſt cited.</p>
               <p>I conceive the meaning clearly to be that in the principal caſe, the Seiſin in groſs of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> alledged in the <hi>Declaration</hi> was not traverſable, but the preſentation, which might be by Vſurpation, and made a good <hi>Title,</hi> though the Plaintiff were not ſeiſed <hi>in groſs</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Plaintiff declare the <hi>Advowſon</hi> to be appendant to a Mannor, and withal ſets forth in his <hi>Declaration</hi> the <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Preſentation</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> as appendant, there the Defendant may traverſe either the <hi>appendency</hi> or the <hi>Preſentation;</hi> for though the <hi>Advowſon</hi> were <hi>appendant,</hi> yet if the Plaintiff preſented not, he had no <hi>Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I infer, that if the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had only counted a <hi>Seiſin</hi> of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> to which the <hi>Advowſon</hi> was appendant without ſhewing the preſentment to be to the Church by vertue of the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency;</hi> the <hi>traverſe</hi> of the appendency had not been good, but it muſt have been of the <hi>Preſentation,</hi> which might have been by <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> notwithſtanding the alledging barely of the <hi>appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> as is reſolved before in the point in the Lord <hi>Buckhurſts</hi> Caſe in <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and in the principal Caſe of <hi>10 H. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Count</hi> is of the <hi>appendency</hi> of the <hi>Advowſon,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Preſentation</hi> to it as <hi>appendant</hi> there, there could be no <hi>Uſurpation</hi> according to the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> in <hi>Sir Henry Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> Caſe in the Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> before cited, and in <hi>Greens</hi> Caſe in the <hi>6th Report of the Lord Cook.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the not obſerving of this difference made the <hi>Reporter</hi> at the end of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It was in that great Caſe endeavoured to avoid the preſſure of this Argument by ſaying the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> in caſes of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were not alike with that of retaining the former Benefice, when the Incumbent was created <hi>Biſhop,</hi> becauſe in the caſe of <hi>Plurality</hi> there was no <hi>actual voidance,</hi> and conſequently no title to the <hi>Patron</hi> to preſent before <hi>Deprivation,</hi> and that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation</hi> prevented the <hi>Deprivation,</hi> which was a <hi>Spiritual Act,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Patron</hi> had not to do, and by a Conſequent only prevented the <hi>voidance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reſolv'd in <hi>Holland's Caſe, Digby's Caſe,</hi>

               <p>Another anſwer hath been likewiſe offered, and paſſeth in the New Books for current, that in the caſe of Pluralities the voidance is by the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and therefore may be diſpenſed with by the ſame Law, but in the caſe of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> made, the voidance is by the <hi>Common Law.</hi>

               <p>If <hi>Canon Law</hi> be made part of the <hi>Law</hi> of this <hi>Land,</hi> then is it as much the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and as well, and by the ſame Authority, as any other part of the Law of the Land.

               </p>
               <p>Vpon this Verdict the Queſtions are two:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The firſt, Whither the Defendants entry into the <hi>ſix Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements</hi> leaſed to <hi>Gower</hi> and <hi>Hillyard,</hi> for not payment of the Rent reſerv'd upon the day of payment, were lawful or not?</p>
               <p>And as to that the Court is of opinion, that the <hi>Defendants</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was lawful; for that the Leaſes were not deriv'd out of the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Peter Temple,</hi> who was but Tenant for life, and had no <hi>Reverſion</hi> in him, but out of the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Arthur
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99478:25"/> Throgmorton,</hi> by <hi>Limitation</hi> of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Deed, <hi>12 Jac.</hi> ſo as the Leaſes were not Leaſes upon Condition to pay the Rent at the day, to which any Demand or Re-entry was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Non-payment; but were Leaſes by Limitation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined abſolutely according to the Limitation.<note place="margin">Littl. f. 235. a.</note> For this, <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi> is expreſs, that the words <hi>quamdiu, dum,</hi> and <hi>dummodo,</hi> are words of <hi>Limitation.</hi> As if a Leaſe be made to a Woman, <hi>dum ſola fuerit,</hi> or <hi>dum caſta vixerit,</hi> or <hi>dummodo ſolverit talem reditum,</hi> or <hi>quamdiu ſolverit talem reditum;</hi> ſo are many other words there mentioned: And if there be not a performance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Limitation, it determines the Leaſe.</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe where a Rent is reſerv'd upon <hi>Condition;</hi> for there is a Contract between the <hi>Leſſor</hi> and <hi>Leſſee,</hi> and the Law evens the Agreement between them, as is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Reaſon, and the ſuppoſition of their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But in the preſent caſe Sir <hi>Peter Temple</hi> had no intereſt in him, out of which ſuch Leaſes could be deriv'd, but had a power only to make them by virtue of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in Sir <hi>Arthur Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortons</hi> Deed, and the Leſſees muſt be ſubject to ſuch Limitations as are thereby made.</p>
               <p>It was agreed by the Council of the Plaintiff, That it was not a Condition for payment of the Rent, nor could it be; but they would call it a <hi>Caution.</hi> A Condition to determine a Leaſe or a Limitation, is a <hi>Caution,</hi> and a material one; but ſuch a <hi>Caution</hi> as hath no more effect than if it were not at all, is a thing inſignificant in Law; and therefore muſt not ſupplant that, which in proper terms is a <hi>Limitation,</hi> and hath an effect.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The next Queſtion is upon the Leaſe of <hi>Looffield,</hi> which ariſes upon the words of the Proviſo, <hi>That it ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Sir <hi>Peter Temple</hi> to demiſe all or any the Premiſſes, which at any time heretofore have been uſually letten or demiſed for the term of 21 years or under, reſerving the Rent thereupon now yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or paid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Iury finding the Lands in <hi>Looffield</hi> to have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed 12th. of the <hi>Queen</hi> for <hi>21</hi> years for <hi>100 l. </hi> Rent, and that that term was expired, and not finding them demis'd by the ſpace of <hi>twenty years</hi> before at the time of the Indenture, <hi>12 Jac.</hi> Whither the Leaſe by Sir <hi>Peter Temple</hi> of them, be warranted by the Proviſo (there being reſerv'd the Rent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the Leaſe in <hi>12. Eliz. viz. 100. l. </hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99478:25"/>
               <p>The <hi>Court</hi> is of opinion, that the Leaſe of <hi>Looffield</hi> is not warranted by that Proviſo, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> It is clear, Sir <hi>Arthur Throgmorton</hi> intended to exclude ſome Lands from being demiſable by that <hi>Proviſo,</hi> namely, Such as at any time before were not uſually let and ſet to Farm: <hi>For where a mans power is limited to leaſe Lands ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially qualified; that is, let and ſet uſually at any time before, when he could not leaſe at all, without ſuch ſpecial power given him, he is abſolutely barr'd from leaſing Land which is not ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It muſt be preſumed Sir <hi>Arthur Throgmorton</hi> knew he had ſuch Lands, as according to his Intention were not at any time before uſually ſet and let, and had reaſon not to ſuffer them to be demiſeable within that <hi>Proviſo,</hi> to the prejudice of thoſe in <hi>Reverſion.</hi> As for example, his <hi>Manſion-houſe, Gardens, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages,</hi> and <hi>Lands occupied in Demeſne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it had been vain to provide againſt the leaſing of Land in ſuch manner condition'd, whereof he had none ſo condition'd. But if notwithſtanding, it ſhall be taken that any his Lands, which at any time paſt, how long ſoever ſince, one, two, or three hundred years, were demiſed, as perhaps the ſcite of his Houſe and all his Demeſne were, though he knew not of it, ſhall therefore now be demiſeable within this <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is the <hi>Proviſo</hi> inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and repugnant to his meaning; for he intended thereby to hinder the demiſing of ſome of his Lands: But by that conſtruction of the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> every part of his Land might be demiſed; for doubtleſs, at ſome time or other, every part of it was demiſed, and probably by Records or other ancient Evidence, might appear ſo to be.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> If this were the meaning of the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> the word <hi>(uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)</hi> in it was to no purpoſe; for it had been much clearer to ſay, That any Lands, at any time heretofore demis'd, ſhould be demiſeable for <hi>21</hi> years by Sir <hi>Peter Temple,</hi> which doubtleſs was not Sir <hi>Arthur's</hi> meaning, and conſequently this Leaſe of <hi>Looffield</hi> not according to his meaning.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Now for the literal ſenſe of the <hi>Proviſo:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rolls, Title Power. f. 261. n. 11. 2 Jac. in Ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o.</note> If power be to make Leaſes for <hi>3</hi> lives, or <hi>21</hi> years, of Lands uſually letten; <hi>Land which hath been twice letten</hi> is within the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> but not <hi>Land which hath been but once letten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore this Land of <hi>Looffield</hi> letten but once, <hi>12 Eliz.</hi> is not within the <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99478:26"/>
               <p>But I inſiſt not much upon this caſe, for the words uſually demis'd may be taken in two ſenſes: The one for the often farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repeated Acts of leaſing Lands, to which ſenſe this Caſe doth reaſonably extend.</p>
               <p>But the other ſenſe of Land uſually demis'd, is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon continuance of Land in leaſe, for that is uſually demis'd; and ſo Land leas'd for <hi>500</hi> years long ſince, is Land uſually demis'd, that is, in leaſe, though it have not been more than once demis'd, which is the more receiv'd ſenſe of the words, <hi>Land uſually demis'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The meaning of the words, <hi>at any time,</hi> is various, and of contrary meaning. If it be asked by way of Queſtion, <hi>Were you at any time at York?</hi> It is the ſame as, <hi>Were you ever,</hi> or <hi>ſometime at York?</hi> So in the Queſtion, <hi>Was this Land at any time in Leaſe?</hi> is the ſame, as, <hi>Was it ever,</hi> or <hi>ſome time in Leaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the words, <hi>at any time,</hi> are not part of a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but of an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> they have a different and contrary meaning. As if it be asked, <hi>Where may I ſee or ſpeak with John Stiles?</hi> and it be anſwered, <hi>You may ſpeak with him, or ſee him at any time at his Houſe.</hi> There the words, <hi>at any time,</hi> ſignifie <hi>at all times,</hi> and not as in the queſtion, <hi>at ſome time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when the words are uſed by way of a plain <hi>enunciation,</hi> and not as <hi>part of a Queſtion</hi> or <hi>Anſwer;</hi> As, <hi>You ſhall be welcome to my Houſe at any time,</hi> ſignifie <hi>You ſhall be welcome at all times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the preſent Caſe, if it-be made a Queſtion, <hi>Was ſuch Land heretofore at any time uſually letten and ſet to Farm?</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in the Queſtion, <hi>Was this Land ever, or at ſome time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore (how long ago ſoever) uſually let to Farm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by way of <hi>enunciation</hi> if it be ſaid, <hi>This Land was uſually let to Farm at any time heretofore;</hi> it means, <hi>This Land was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, at all times heretofore, let to Farm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this Land was uſually in Paſture at <hi>any time heretofore,</hi> ſignifies, this Land <hi>was always,</hi> or <hi>commonly in Paſture hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, you may leaſe any Land heretofore letten to Farm at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, uſually, is the ſame with heretofore letten to Farm commonly at all times. And this Conſtruction of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> agrees both with the words and intention of Sir <hi>Arthur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what was not farmed at the time of this <hi>Proviſo</hi> made, nor <hi>20 years</hi> before, could not be ſaid to be at any time before commonly Farmed; for thoſe <hi>20 years</hi> was a time before, in which it was not farmed.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99478:26"/>
               <p>But to come cloſer, <hi>The Proviſo is that Leaſes may be made for 21 years of any the Lands in the Deed, reſerving the Rents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſerved at the time of the Deed made, viz. 12 Jac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which neceſſarily implies, that the Land demiſeable by that <hi>Proviſo,</hi> muſt be Land which then was under Rent; for where no Rent then was, the Rent then thereupon reſerv'd could not be reſerv'd. But <hi>Looffield</hi> had then no Rent upon it, for it was not let of <hi>20 years</hi> before, nor then, and therefore was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeable by that <hi>Proviſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words <hi>(or more)</hi> will not at all help the Plaintiff, for the words <hi>(more or leſs)</hi> are words of <hi>relation;</hi> the one of <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to what was before; the other of <hi>diminution;</hi> for <hi>(more or leſs)</hi> muſt relate to ſomething poſitive in the kind before, and can never be a relation to nothing.</p>
               <p>So <hi>(more wages)</hi> neceſſarily implies ſome before, <hi>(more meat) (more drink) (more company)</hi> and, in all expreſſions <hi>(more)</hi> denotes a relation to ſomewhat before of the kind; and in the preſent Caſe, reſerving <hi>(more Rent)</hi> muſt imply ſome before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And therefore where none was at the time of the Deed made <hi>12 Jac.</hi> there cannot, in any congruity of ſpeech, more be reſerved, or intended to be reſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quaere,</hi> If the Record be mended in the point of finding the death of Sir <hi>Peter Temple,</hi> and when he died.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Plaintiff demands <hi>Oyer</hi> of the Deed of Grant, and hath it in theſe words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then the Plaintiff replies, that before the time of the <hi>Caption,</hi> that is, <hi>A die Paſchae in quindecim dies,</hi> a <hi>Fine</hi> was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in the Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> in the <hi>One and twentieth</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> before the Iuſtices there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> between <hi>Richard Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Eſquire, and the <hi>Avowants</hi> of the ſaid Rent, with Warranty to the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> and his Heirs.</p>
               <p>And that this <hi>Fine</hi> was to the uſe of the <hi>Conizors</hi> and their Heirs, and demands Iudgment.</p>
               <p>The Defendant thereupon demurrs.</p>
               <p>WHERE the Law is known, and clear, though it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equitable and inconvenient, the Iudges muſt determine as the Law is, without regarding the unequitableneſs or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99478:28"/>
               <p>Thoſe defects, if they happen in the Law, can only be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by Parliament; therefore we find many <hi>Statutes</hi> repealed, and <hi>Laws</hi> abrogated by <hi>Parliament,</hi> as inconvenient, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch repeal or abrogation, were in the Courts of <hi>Law</hi> to be ſtrictly obſerved.</p>
               <p>But where the <hi>Law</hi> is doubtful, and not clear, the Iudges ought to interpret the <hi>Law</hi> to be as is moſt conſonant to equity, and leaſt inconvenient.</p>
               <p>And for this reaſon, <hi>Littleton</hi> in many of his Caſes, reſolves the <hi>Law</hi> not to be that way which is inconvenient, which Sir <hi>Edward-Cook,</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon him, often obſerves; and cites the places, <hi>Sect. 87.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the preſent Caſe there are ſeveral <hi>Coparceners,</hi> whereof ſome have Husbands ſeis'd of a <hi>Rent Charge</hi> in tail: the <hi>Rent</hi> is behind, and they all levy a <hi>Fine</hi> of the <hi>Rent</hi> to the uſe of them and their Heirs.</p>
               <p>If after the <hi>Fine</hi> levied, they are barr'd from diſtraining for the Rent arrear, before the <hi>Fine,</hi> is the Queſtion? It being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed they can have no other remedy, becauſe the Rent is in the reality, and ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>If they cannot diſtrain, the Conſequents are,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That there is a manifeſt duty to them of a Rent, for which the Law gives no remedy, which makes in ſuch caſe the having of right to a thing, and having none, not to differ: for <hi>where there is no right, no relief by Law can be expected;</hi> and here, where there is right, the relief is as little, which is as great an abſurdity as is poſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> It was neither the Intention of the <hi>Conizors,</hi> to remit this Arrear of Rent to the Tenant, nor the Tenants to expect it: nor could the <hi>Conizors</hi> remit it but by their words or intentions, or both; nor did they do it by either.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> It is both <hi>equitable in it ſelf,</hi> and of <hi>publick convenience,</hi> that the Law ſhould aſſiſt men to recover their due, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd from them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Men in time of Contagion, of Dearth, of War, may be occaſioned to ſettle their Eſtates when they cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect payment of <hi>Rents</hi> from their Tenants for Lives, or others, and conſequently not ſeaſonably diſtrain them; and it would be a general inconvenience in ſuch caſe to loſe all their <hi>Rents</hi> in Arrear. So as both in Equity and Conveniency the <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be with the <hi>Avowants.</hi>

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99478:28"/>
               <p>In the next place we muſt examine, Whether the <hi>Avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> that is, the <hi>Conizors of the Fine,</hi> be clearly barr'd by Law to diſtrain for the <hi>Rent</hi> arreare before the Fine? For it muſt be agreed, they have no other remedy by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or otherwiſe: to which purpoſe I ſhall open ſome Premiſes, that my Concluſion may be better appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:99478:29"/>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall agree the Caſe ſo much inſiſted on, which is ſaid to be agreed <hi>per Curiam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Andrew Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell's Caſe, 4. Rep. f. 49.</note> in <hi>Andrew Ognell's</hi> Caſe, in the <hi>fourth Rep.</hi> That if a man be ſeized of a Rent-ſervice, or Rent-charge in Fee, and grant it over by his Deed to another and his Heirs, <hi>and the Tenant Attorn,</hi> ſuch Grantor is without remedy for the Rent arrear before his Grant; for diſtrain he cannot, and other remedy he hath not, becauſe all privity between him and the <hi>Tenant</hi> is deſtroyed by the <hi>Attornment</hi> to the <hi>Grantee,</hi> and he hath no more right than any Stranger to come upon the Land, after ſuch transferring over of the Rent.</p>
               <p>I ſhall likewiſe agree another Caſe, That if ſuch <hi>Grantee</hi> ſhould regrant the ſame Rent back to the <hi>Grantor,</hi> either in fee, in tail, or for life, and the <hi>Tenant</hi> Attorn, as he muſt to this regrant, yet the firſt <hi>Grantor</hi> ſhall never be enabled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain for Arrears due to him before he granted over the Rent; for now the privity between him and the <hi>Tenant</hi> begins but from the <hi>Attornment</hi> to the regrant, the former being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deſtroyed, and the <hi>Tenant</hi> no more diſtrainable for the ancient <hi>Arrears</hi> than he was upon the creation of the Rent, for Arrears incurred before, till firſt attorn'd.</p>
               <p>If the Caſe in queſtion prove to be the ſame in effect with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Caſes, then the reaſon of Law for theſe Caſes muſt ſway and determine the Caſe in queſtion.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that there is no likeneſs or parity between the Caſe in queſtion, and either of thoſe Caſes, either for the <hi>fact of the Caſes,</hi> or the <hi>reaſon of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore begin with comparing this Caſe with the firſt of thoſe Caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> In the firſt of thoſe Caſes, he that is ſeis'd of the <hi>Rent-charge,</hi> doth intend to transferr his Eſtate in the Rent to the <hi>Grantee,</hi> and it is accordingly actually transferr'd by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <hi>Attornment</hi> to the <hi>Grant.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The <hi>Grantee</hi> by his <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Attornment</hi> to it, becomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſeis'd of the Rent, and may enjoy the benefit of it by perception of the Rent.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> But in the Caſe in queſtion, the <hi>Conizors</hi> of the <hi>Fine</hi> did never intend to transfer their Eſtate in the Rent to the <hi>Conizee,</hi> nor that any <hi>Attornment</hi> be made to him: What a man intends to paſs to another, he intends to be without it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at leaſt for ſome time, which is not in this Caſe.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> The <hi>Conizee</hi> never becomes actually ſeiz'd of the Rent, and not only doth not, but never can enjoy the perception of it; for there is no moment of time wherein the <hi>Conizors</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not actually in ſeiſin of it, and conſequently may diſtrain if it be in Arrear, and the <hi>Conizee</hi> can never have actually ſeiſin, or poſſibility to have <hi>Attornment</hi> or diſtrain, his ſeiſin being but a meer fiction, and an invented form of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi> only.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> The <hi>Conizee's</hi> Wife is never dowable of it.</p>

                  <hi>4.</hi> It is not ſubject to any <hi>Statutes, Recognizances,</hi> or <hi>Debts</hi> of the <hi>Conizee.</hi>

               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> It is never poſſible to deſcend to his Heir, for it inſtantly veſts in the <hi>Conizors.</hi>

               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6.</hi> It can never be Arrear to the <hi>Conizee,</hi> nor hath he ever a poſſibility to diſtrain for it.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe what is agreed in the Lord <hi>Cromwell's</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">L. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's Caſe, 2. Rep. f. 77.</note> 
                  <hi>2.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore that firſt Caſe cited out of the Report of <hi>Andrew Ognell's</hi> Caſe, which I admit to be good Law, hath no reſemblance with the preſent Caſe, in any circumſtance or conſequent; but had the Fine been to a third perſons uſe, the conſequents had been the ſame as in the Caſe cited out of <hi>Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell's</hi> Caſe, not as to the <hi>Conizee,</hi> but as to that third perſon to whom the rent was intended.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Beſides, it hath been admitted at the Bar, that if the Fine had been levied without conſideration, and no uſes expreſs'd, the <hi>Conizors</hi> might then have diſtrained for the Arrear, becauſe the uſes were the ſame as before, which, if granted, it reſolves the Queſtion, for the Attornment and power to diſtrain follows the poſſeſſion, and not the uſe: And if after the ſuppoſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Coniſee, and his being ſeis'd to the old uſes, when the <hi>Statute</hi> gives the poſſeſſion back to the old uſes, the Conizors might diſtrain for the Arrears before the Fine, as well as for thoſe after, what hinders their diſtraining for them ſtill? For the poſſeſſion which the <hi>Statute</hi> gives to the old uſes, is as new a poſſeſſion as that it gives to the new uſes, and the privity is the ſame in both Caſes in regard of the Tenant.</p>
               <p>And it is common experience, that a Fine levied without conſideration or uſe expreſſed,<note place="margin">Sir Moyle Finch's Caſe, 6th. Rep. f. 68. b.</note> is to the uſe of the Conizor and his Heirs, who may have an action of waſte after the Fine, for waſte committed before, as well as he could before the Fine. The inſtant poſſeſſion of the Conizee notwithſtanding which, differs not from this Caſe.</p>
               <p>The next enquiry is, What affinity this Caſe hath with the ſecond Caſe propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That if one ſeiz'd of a Rent in Fee, grants it over to a Stranger and his Heirs, and the Tenant attorns; if ſuch Grantee regrants the Rent back to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and his Heirs, there muſt be a new <hi>Attorment</hi> of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Regrant; for the privity by the firſt Attornment was totally deſtroyed, and all Arrears of Rent loſt when the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant attorn'd to the Grantee, which Caſe I take to be clear Law, for by the Regrant a total new Eſtate is gain'd in the Rent, and thereby he who hath the Rent as if he never had any former Eſtate in it.</p>
               <p>And in the preſent Caſe, the Eſtates after the Fine are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new, and other Eſtates in the Conizors (to which the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant never attorn'd) than the <hi>Conizors</hi> had before the Fine in theſe Reſpects:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before the <hi>Fine,</hi> the Husbands had but Eſtates in right of their Wives, and now they are <hi>Jointenants</hi> with their Wives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Wives, before the Fine had Eſtates of Inheritance abſolute, and now they are Iointenants with their Husbands, and among themſelves where Survivorſhip obtains.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Women were <hi>Coparceners</hi> before, and the Husbands in right of their Wives, and they are now all <hi>Jointenants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99478:31"/>4. Two of the <hi>Coparceners</hi> had the Inheritance of entire <hi>third parts,</hi> and the two other of one intire <hi>third part;</hi> and now the four Women and three Husbands are equally Iointenants, which are Eſtates much differing from the Eſtates they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fine.</p>
               <p>I muſt agree, <hi>That where perſons ſeiz'd of a Rent-charge, by granting it over with Attornment of the Tenant, have totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their Eſtate, and after retake, either ſuch an Eſtate as they had before, or a differing Eſtate in the Rent, they muſt have a new Attornment, and the former privity is wholly deſtroyed, and conſequently no Arrears can be diſtrain'd for, by reaſon of the firſt privity which is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this Caſe the <hi>Conizors</hi> never were, for any moment of time, out of poſſeſſion of their firſt Eſtate, nor deſtroyed the firſt privity by any new Attornment, which either was, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could be; but only ſome have enlarg'd their Eſtate, ſome diminiſh't it, others alter'd it, without deſtroying the old privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which may ſtand well with the <hi>Rules of Law;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they may diſtrain for Rent arrears, and avow lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of the firſt privity ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>And I muſt obſerve in this Caſes, that the <hi>Avowants,</hi> after the Fine, are the ſame perſons avowing as before. 2. That after the Fine, there is but one <hi>common Avowry</hi> as before. 3. That there is no new perſon after the <hi>Fine,</hi> between whom and the Tenant there was not a privity before the <hi>Fine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That a mans Eſtate in a Rent-charge, may be enlarg'd, diminiſh'd, or otherwiſe alter'd, and no new Attornment, or privity requiſite to ſuch alteration of Eſtate.</p>

                  <p>If a <hi>common Recovery</hi> had been to uſes of Lordſhips and Mannors before the <hi>Statute</hi> of 27. the <hi>Recoverors</hi> had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to make the Tenants attorn (for a <hi>quid Juris clamat</hi> would not lye upon a Recovery) before the Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">7 H. 8. c. 4.</note>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99478:33"/> there is no remedy often in Law, are not therefore <hi>diſpenced</hi> with, and diſcharged by the party, as is ſuperficially ſaid in <hi>Ognell's</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Conizee</hi> of a <hi>Rent</hi> granted by <hi>Fine</hi> to uſes cannot have any actual ſeiſin, or be in poſſeſſion of ſuch Rent, ſince the <hi>Statute of</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Statute of 27 H. 8</hi> If a Feoffment had been to uſes and no Livery given, or given by one Attorney when it ought to have been by two, the uſes in ſuch Deed of Feoffment could never riſe; ſo if a <hi>Reverſion</hi> had been granted to uſes, and no Attornment to the <hi>Grantee,</hi> no uſe could riſe, becauſe there was no ſufficient Eſtate in poſſeſſion. And when the Statute of Vſes came, it could have no operation when the Eſtates in poſſeſſion were not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>So if an Eſtate for life had been granted to the uſe of a man and his Heirs, an Eſtate in Fee could not riſe out of it by the Statute of <hi>27 H. 8. c. 10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if before the Statute, a Reverſion had been granted by Fine to Vſes, and no <hi>quid Juris clamat</hi> brought, though the Land paſs'd by the Fine, yet the Tenant could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, nor a <hi>Writ of Waſte</hi> brought againſt him until he <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn'd;</hi> and when the <hi>Statute</hi> came to transferr the uſe into the poſſeſſion, it could be but into ſuch a poſſeſſion as the <hi>Conizee</hi> had by the <hi>Fine,</hi> without power to diſtrain, or bring <hi>Waſte,</hi> for the words of the Statute are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Eſtate, Title, Right and Poſſeſſion that was in ſuch perſon or perſons, that were, or hereafter ſhall be ſeis'd of any Lands or Hereditaments, to the uſe, confidence, or truſt of any perſon or perſons, be from henceforth adjudged to be in him or them that have, or hereafter ſhall have ſuch uſe, confidence, or truſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore if before the Statute of <hi>27.</hi> a <hi>Fine</hi> had been levied of a Rent-charge to uſes, as this Caſe is, if before <hi>Attornment</hi> to, or <hi>ſeiſin</hi> had by the <hi>Conizee,</hi> the Statute had come and brought the poſſeſſion of the Rent to the uſe, the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> could have had the Rent but as a Rent-ſeck, for which he could not diſtrain for want of <hi>Attornment,</hi> nor have an <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> for want of ſeiſin, for the <hi>Conizee</hi> had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſion of the Rent; but after Attornment and ſeiſin to or by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> his poſſeſſion perhaps became perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>But ſince the Statute, if a <hi>Fine</hi> be levied of a Reverſion of Lands to uſes, or of a <hi>Rent,</hi> becauſe the uſe and poſſeſſion by the <hi>Statute</hi> come inſtantly together, and the <hi>Conizee</hi> of the Fine hath no time poſſible to bring, either a <hi>quid Juris clamat,</hi> or a <hi>quem redditum reddit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir Moyl Finch's Caſe, Coke 6. f. 68. a</note> for, or to receive an <hi>Attornment</hi> to, perfect his poſſeſſion.

                  </p>
                  <p>The intent of the Statute of <hi>27.</hi> which was to bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poſſeſſion and the uſe, when the uſe was to one or more perſons, and the poſſeſſion in one or more other ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons, was ſoon after the <hi>Statute</hi> wholly declined, upon what good conſtruction or inference I know not.</p>
                  <p>For now the uſe (by the name of truſt) which were one and the ſame before the <hi>Statute,</hi> remains ſeparately in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the poſſeſſion ſeparately in others, as it did before the <hi>Statute,</hi> and are not brought together but by <hi>Decree in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> or the <hi>voluntary Conveyance</hi> of the poſſeſſor of the Land, to <hi>Ceſtuy que truſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as now the principal uſe of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>27.</hi> eſpecially upon <hi>Fines</hi> levied to uſes, is not to bring together a poſſeſſion and uſe, which at no time were ſeparate the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to introduce a general form of Conveyance, by which the <hi>Conizors</hi> of the Fine, who are as <hi>Donors</hi> in the Caſe, may execute their intents and purpoſes at pleaſure, either by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their Eſtates to Strangers, by enlarging, diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or altering them, to and among themſelves, at their pleaſure, without obſerving that rigour and ſtrictneſs of Law for the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Conizee,</hi> as was requiſite before the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which I have ſufficiently evidenc'd by ſhewing that the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornment</hi> of the Leſſee to the <hi>Conizee</hi> or <hi>Reverſioner,</hi> or of the Tenant to him, as <hi>Grantee</hi> of the Rent-charge, is now diſpenc'd with, which was not before the <hi>Statute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if that were now requiſite, the <hi>Conizors</hi> could not only not diſtrain for the Rent due before the <hi>Fine,</hi> but not for the Rent due ſince the <hi>Fine;</hi> nor doth the <hi>Statute</hi> help the matter, becauſe the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> is in poſſeſſion of the Rent by the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> and therefore needs no <hi>Attornment,</hi> for that is true, when the <hi>Conizee</hi> hath a perfect poſſeſſion, but without <hi>Attornment</hi> the <hi>Conizee</hi> had no perfect poſſeſſion impowring him to diſtrain; and therefore the <hi>Statute</hi> can bring no perfect poſſeſſion to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to that end.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall therefore make the Queſtion upon this Caſe, ſuch as nakedly it is, without involving it in any difficulty of terms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> brings a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and declares, That <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was ſeis'd of the <hi>Advowſon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Norfield in groſs,</hi> as of Fee, and preſented, and derives the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon</hi> to himſelf, and the Church became void by the death of the <hi>Queens Preſentee;</hi> and he is diſturbed to preſent by the Defendant <hi>Jervis.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. If you will recover any thing from another man, it is not enough for you to deſtroy <hi>his Title,</hi> but you muſt prove your own better than his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no ſenſe, if you will quarrel my Poſſeſſion or Right, and I, to avoid your Title effectually, either by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing</hi> it, which is denying, or confeſſing and avoiding it, do induce that with a Title of mine own, that you ſhall fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Title to impeach it, and forſake your own, as I ſaid before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

It is to no end the Plaintiff ſhould ſet forth any Title at all, if he be not to make it good; but it ſhould ſerve his turn only to impeach the Defendants Title, and conclude ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably, That if I can make it appear the Defendant hath not a good Title, therefore I have and muſt have Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for me.</p>

               <p>By this Verdict, in the recited Indenture, if any ſuch were, of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> the <hi>Farm</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton,</hi> and the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norton,</hi> were the ſame thing; and the <hi>Mannor</hi> known and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd by the name of the <hi>Farm,</hi> as well as the <hi>Farm</hi> by name of the <hi>Mannor.</hi> The <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton</hi> being call'd the <hi>Farm</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton,</hi> becauſe it was lett to <hi>Farm,</hi> and <hi>rented</hi> out; and the <hi>Farm</hi> called the <hi>Mannor,</hi> becauſe it had the <hi>Requiſits</hi> of a <hi>Mannor, viz.

                  <hi>4.</hi> By the Demiſe of <hi>1. Mar.</hi> ſubſequent, <hi>the ſaid Mannor or Farm</hi> is demis'd.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>200 Acres</hi> in queſtion, being found to be parcel of the ſaid <hi>Mannor,</hi> conſequently they are recited to be demis'd by that <hi>Indenture</hi> ſuppos'd of <hi>29 H. 8. But the Jury find not the Mannor and Farm to be the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing to be noted is, That by that recited Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> if any ſuch were, ſeveral <hi>Rents</hi> were reſerved upon ſeveral particulars, and not one intire <hi>Rent</hi> upon the whole, namely <hi>9 l. </hi> upon the <hi>Mannor</hi> or <hi>Farm;</hi> Another <hi>Rent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Parſonage,</hi> another on the <hi>Vicaridge;</hi> and ſo upon ſeveral other particulars.</p>
               <p>And by the Leaſe of <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> it is <hi>yielding and paying ſuch, and the like Rents, in the Plural Number, as are reſerved by the ſaid firſt Indenture.</hi> So as the <hi>Rents</hi> were ſeveral in the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, by the meaning of that of <hi>1 Mar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>yielding and paying ſuch and like Rent, as is reſerv'd by the latter Indenture, for the Premiſſes therein contain'd.</hi> Here it is <hi>ſuch Rent,</hi> in the ſingular number, as is reſerv'd, not as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as in the former.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99478:45"/>
               <p>Then in the <hi>Clauſe</hi> of <hi>Re-entry</hi> for Non-payment, it is that the Re-entry ſhould be into ſuch of the Premiſſes, whereupon ſuch Rent being behind was reſerv'd, therefore not into all the Premiſſes.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, That there being ſeveral Rents, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Demands were reſpectively to be made before Re-entry, as well for thoſe reſerv'd in the <hi>firſt Indenture,</hi> as for that in the <hi>ſecond Indenture</hi> recited.</p>
               <p>And it being found, That the Demand made by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> at the Parſonage-houſe in <hi>Forty three,</hi> was for the half years Rent reſerved of all the Premiſſes demis'd by the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> it follows, That more Rent was demanded than was payable in any one place, conſequently the Demand not good, nor the Re-entry purſuing it; and thus far the Caſe is clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defendant: For the <hi>Leaſe</hi> of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by that Re-entry, in all, nor in part, if the Leaſes of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> were well and ſufficiently found by the <hi>Jury</hi> to have been made.</p>
               <p>Note, The <hi>Jury</hi> finding that the <hi>Rent</hi> reſerved for all the Premiſſes, was behind for half a year, ending at <hi>Michaelmas, 1643.</hi> not expreſſing the Sum of the Rent, is no more than to find, That no Rent was paid for the ſaid half year.</p>
               <p>And their finding, That the <hi>Biſhop</hi> did demand the ſaid half years Rent, finding no Sum by him demanded, is no more than to find, That he demanded ſuch Rent as was due for the ſaid half year. So as notwithſtanding the <hi>Juries</hi> finding, That no Rent was paid for the ſaid half year, and their finding of the <hi>Biſhop's</hi> demanding of what was due for the ſaid half year; It doth not therefore follow, That they find any Rent to be reſerv'd by the ſaid Leaſe of <hi>1. Mar.</hi> or that there was a Demand of any Rent admitted to be ſo reſerv'd.</p>
               <p>But if the Leaſes of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> be not well and ſufficiently found by the <hi>Jury</hi> to have been made; The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then is, That in Law there are no ſuch Leaſes; for <hi>de non apparentibus, &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio ad omnem juris effectum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then it follows, That the Leaſe of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> of all the Premiſſes ſpecified in the <hi>Indenture</hi> of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and of all ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Indenture of <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> for <hi>Ninety years Habendum,</hi> from the reſpective Expirations of the terms ſpecified, and under the reſpective Rents reſerv'd by thoſe <hi>Indentures,</hi> will be void as to the terms intended to be granted, and the Rents reſerv'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beginning of the terms and particulars of the Rents
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99478:45"/> can be known, but from the Demiſes <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> when no ſuch Demiſes are, becauſe the <hi>Jury</hi> hath found no ſuch.</p>
               <p>For this the Caſe of <hi>3 E. 6.</hi> reported by the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> in his <hi>Title of Leaſes, N. 62.</hi> is clear, and in ſeveral Caſes ſince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd, is admitted for good Law.</p>

Therefore the Leaſe of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> for <hi>Ninety years,</hi> ſhall commence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Sealing, and conſequently ended about the <hi>21</hi> or <hi>22</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</p>
               <p>And then the Defendant <hi>Huntington's</hi> Entry, the <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 21 Car. 2.</hi> by command of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> was lawful, the term of <hi>Ninety years</hi> granted <hi>1 Mar.</hi> and then beginning, being long before expired.</p>
               <p>And by the ſame Reaſon, If a Leaſe be granted to <hi>J. S.</hi> for <hi>Forty years,</hi> to commence after the expiration of the term gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>J.

               <p>And conſequently in the preſent Caſe, though the Leaſe for <hi>Ninety years,</hi> which number of years is expreſs'd, be a good Leaſe, to commence immediately from <hi>1 Mar.</hi> yet the Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Rent being ſuch thereupon as was reſerv'd by the Leaſes of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> when in truth there are no ſuch Leaſes, muſt be a void Reſervation upon the Leaſe of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> becauſe there is no expreſſion of any Rent, but that which was reſerved in Leaſes, which are not all <hi>Ad omnem Juris effectum</hi> in this Caſe, becauſe they are not found.</p>

               <p>For to find that ſuch a <hi>Letter</hi> was written, or ſuch a <hi>Book</hi> made by <hi>J. S.</hi> is not to find that all things, or any thing contain'd or mention'd in that <hi>Letter</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> are, or is true.</p>
               <p>No more finding a certain Deed, as that of <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> to be ſeal'd and deliver'd by <hi>J.S.</hi> is not a finding that every thing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or recited in that Deed, is true.</p>
               <div type="context">
                  <head>The Context of the <hi>Verdict</hi> explain'd.</head>
                  <p>I find it conceiv'd by ſome, That by the words of the Verdict, <hi>Habendum à fine prioris dimiſſionis in Indentura praedict. mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</hi> the Iury have found two things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt from the words <hi>Habendum à fine prioris dimiſſionis,</hi> That there was a former Demiſe from the Expiration of which the term granted <hi>1 Mariae</hi> begins.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond from the words <hi>In Indentura praedict. mentionat.</hi> That ſuch former Demiſe is mentioned in the Indenture <hi>1 Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thence conclude, That a former Demiſe, mentioned in the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> is by the Iury found to have been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made: And conſequently the ſenſe of the words of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and Iury's meaning muſt be, as if they had been <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> from the Expiration of a former Demiſe, and which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Demiſe is mentioned in the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſurely there is a clear difference between the Iuries find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a former <hi>Demiſe to be,</hi> and their finding a former <hi>Demiſe mentioned</hi> to be: For a former Demiſe may be found mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, which notwithſtanding never was.</p>
                  <p>The words therefore of the Verdict, genuinely read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, are, <hi>Habendum from the Expiration of a former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (not which poſitively was) but Habendum from the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a former Demiſe mentioned in the Indenture of 1 Mar. to be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:99478:47"/>
                  <p>But a Demiſe may be mentioned in the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> to be, which yet never was.</p>
                  <p>And then the meaning of the words and Iury will evidently be <hi>Habendum,</hi> from the Expiration of a former demiſe which the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> mentions, recites, or ſaith to be formerly made.</p>
                  <p>And by this the <hi>Jury</hi> do not find, That any former demiſe, mention'd in the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> was really made.</p>
                  <p>I muſt agree, That as a Witneſs may prove the Contents of a <hi>Deed</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> ſo may a <hi>Jury</hi> find them, the <hi>Deed</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf not being found <hi>in haec verba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if a <hi>Jury,</hi> by their Verdict, ſhall take upon them to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Contents of a <hi>Deed,</hi> and yet by the ſame Verdict find that <hi>Deed in haec verba,</hi> the Court is not to regard the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they have made of the Subſtance of the <hi>Deed,</hi> but the <hi>Deed</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, If a demiſe ſhould be made to <hi>J. S.</hi> for a certain term of years, <hi>Habendum,</hi> from the day of the making the demiſe, and the <hi>Jury</hi> ſhould find the <hi>Deed</hi> made to <hi>J. S.</hi> for the term <hi>Habendum</hi> from the making of the demiſe, <hi>Cujus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Indent. fact.</hi> to <hi>J. S. tenor ſequitur in haec verba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Verdict, it both appear'd what Collection the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> made in their Iudgment of the <hi>Habendum,</hi> of the <hi>Deed</hi> to <hi>J. S.</hi> and alſo what the <hi>Deed</hi> it ſelf <hi>ſyllabically</hi> was, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from what the <hi>Jury</hi> conceiv'd it to be; for the <hi>Habendum</hi> in the <hi>Deed</hi> appears to be from the day of making of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but the <hi>Jury</hi> collected it to be from the making. Here the Court ſhall not regard the Collection by the <hi>Jury,</hi> but the <hi>Deed</hi> it ſelf, as to the Commencement of the Term.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> So in the preſent Caſe, the <hi>Jury</hi> finding, That the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Oxford,</hi> by his Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> demis'd the <hi>Mannor of Hooknorton Habendum,</hi> from the Expiration of a former demiſe therein mention'd, for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, and then ſetting forth the Indenture <hi>verbatim;</hi> is not a finding at large; and as if no leaſe <hi>verbatim,</hi> were found that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> made a leaſe for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, to begin from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of a former demiſe, made <hi>29 H. 8</hi> or <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> for a certain term, but is a Collection of the Subſtance, as they conceiv'd of the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>1.

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99478:48"/>
                  <p>And conſequently, the Deed it ſelf being <hi>ſyllabically</hi> found, the Court is not to regard their Collection of the purport of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Another Reaſon is, That if thoſe words in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>Habendum</hi> from the end of a former Demiſe mentioned in the ſaid Indenture, had been omitted, and they had only found the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had Seal'd and Executed the Indenture, <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> to <hi>Croker, Cujus quidem Indent. tenor ſequitur in haec verba, &amp;c.</hi> all that is pretended to be found by this Verdict, had been as fully, and more clearly found, by finding the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>For finding that Indenture in <hi>haec verba,</hi> they had found that the Biſhop had demis'd the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum,</hi> from the Expiration of a former Demiſe therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for <hi>Ninety</hi> years; which is all they have now found. Therefore the finding by way of <hi>redundance,</hi> over and beſides finding the Deed it ſelf, what was <hi>equally</hi> found in finding the Deed only, is not to be regarded, but as over-doing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Beſides, ſuch a conſtruction of the Verdict makes it abſolutely equivocal and uncertain; for if the words, <hi>Haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum à fine prioris dimiſſionis in Indentura predict. mentionat.</hi> be but their Summary Collection of what the Indenture <hi>1 Mar.</hi> contains, then it is but finding a recital of a former Demiſe; but if otherwiſe, it is finding a former Demiſe really and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, which do <hi>toto coelo differre,</hi> and confound the Iudgment of the Court.</p>

                  <p>But ſuch Anſwer did not aſſert, That there was actually ſuch a former Demiſe, as is mentioned in that Deed of <hi>1 Mar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then muſt the <hi>Jury,</hi> aſſerting but the ſame thing in the ſame words, be ſtrain'd to aſſert more, <hi>viz.</hi> That there actually was ſuch a former Demiſe as is recited in the Indenture <hi>1 Mariae?</hi>

                  <p>Be it then underſtood the Demiſe <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> for in that the <hi>Mannor</hi> is clearly named; the Conſequence muſt be, That the Deed of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> which is an intire leaſe, as well of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> as of the <hi>Vicaridge, Parſonage,</hi> and of other things under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rents, for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, commencing, as to the <hi>Mannor,</hi> from the Expiration of the ſuppos'd Demiſe <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> ſhall be a good leaſe for <hi>Ninety</hi> years thence forwards, becauſe that reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Demiſe is alſo ſuppos'd to be poſitively found by the <hi>Jury,</hi> by thoſe words of their Verdict.</p>

                  <p>But now for Authority, I will reſume the Caſe formerly cited of <hi>3 E. 6.</hi> in the Lord <hi>Brook.</hi> If <hi>A.</hi> makes a Leaſe to <hi>B.

                  <p>And who will ſay in this Caſe, That becauſe the <hi>Jury</hi> find a Leaſe made to <hi>B.</hi> for <hi>Forty years Habendum,</hi> from the Expiration of a former Leaſe made to <hi>J.

                  <p>Exactly parallel to this is our preſent Caſe; the <hi>Jury</hi> find the <hi>Biſhop of Oxford,</hi> by a Leaſe dated the <hi>Fourteenth</hi> of <hi>October, 1 Mariae,</hi> demiſed to <hi>Groker</hi> the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norton, Habendum,</hi> to him and his Aſſigns for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, from the Expiration of a former Demiſe, mentioned in the ſaid Indenture of Leaſe <hi>1 Mariae:</hi> But do not affirm or find, explicitly or implicitly, any former demiſe made when they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find ſummarily the <hi>Habendum</hi> of the Leaſe, <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> which mentions ſuch a former Demiſe.</p>

                  <p>From this Caſe theſe Concluſions are with clearneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1.</hi> That if a leaſe be found ſpecially by a <hi>Jury,</hi> in which one or more other leaſes are recited, the finding of ſuch leaſe is not a finding of any the recited leaſes: Therefore the finding of the leaſe made to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was not a finding of the leaſe therein recited, to be made to <hi>Anne Seaton</hi> in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond thing clearly deducible out of this Caſe, is, That although the <hi>Jury,</hi> by their Special Verdict, did find that <hi>John</hi> the Son, Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> did by his Indenture demiſe to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> for <hi>Thirty</hi> years, the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Blacon, Habendum,</hi> from the End, Surrender, or Forfeiture of a former leaſe thereof made to <hi>Anne Seaton,</hi> dated the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>February, 28 H. 8.</hi> yet this was not a finding of any ſuch leaſe made to <hi>Anne Seaton,</hi> but only a finding of the <hi>Habendum,</hi> as it was in the leaſe made to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which mentioned ſuch a leaſe to be made to <hi>Anne Seaton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99478:50"/>
                  <p>So in our preſent Caſe, the <hi>Jury</hi> finding that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Oxford, 1 Mariae,</hi> did demiſe the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton</hi> to <hi>John Croker Habendum,</hi> for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, from the Expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a former Demiſe mentioned in the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> is not a finding of any ſuch former Demiſe to be made; but a finding, that in the Indenture <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> it is ſuggeſted there was ſuch a former Demiſe, and no more.</p>
                  <p>And if any man ſhall object, That in <hi>Rocheſter's</hi> Caſe the Reaſon why no ſuch leaſe is found to be made to <hi>Anne Seaton,</hi> in <hi>28 H. 8.</hi> to be, becauſe it is found that the leaſe made to <hi>Anne Seaton</hi> was in <hi>27 H. 8.</hi> that is not to the purpoſe, becauſe the <hi>Jury</hi> might find, and truly, that a leaſe was made to her, Dated the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>February, 27 H. 8.</hi> but that was no hindrance; but that another leaſe was made to her in <hi>28 H. 8.</hi> as is mentioned in <hi>Rocheſter's</hi> leaſe, which had been a Surrender in Law of that made in <hi>27 H. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore it is manifeſt, That the ſole Reaſon why no ſuch leaſe was admitted to be in <hi>28 H. 8.</hi> is no other than, becauſe the <hi>Jury</hi> find no ſuch to have been made, but find a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of it only in <hi>Rocheſter's</hi> leaſe: And it is the ſame exactly in our preſent Caſe.</p>
                  <p>The third thing deducible from the Caſe, is, That a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by Indenture for a term <hi>Habendum,</hi> from the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of another recited or mentioned term therein,<note place="margin">35 H. 6. 34 Br. Tit. Faits. p. 4. 12 H. 4. 23 Br.

                  <p>The Queſtion was, Whether any of theſe leaſes, made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Hamlett Freer</hi> or <hi>Morley,</hi> be good, or were <hi>in eſſe</hi> at the time of the leaſe, made by Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: Sir <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> claiming the Inheritance from the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Norris</hi> the Leaſes from <hi>Freer</hi> and <hi>Morley,</hi> and under him the Defendant. And Iudgment was given in <hi>Cheſter</hi> for the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>And upon a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> of this Iudgment brought in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> wherein the <hi>Error</hi> aſſign'd was, The giving of Iudgment for the Plaintiff. After <hi>ſeveral Arguments</hi> at <hi>Barr,</hi> and at the <hi>Bench, Seriatim</hi> by the Iuſtices, it was unanimouſly agreed, The Iudgment in <hi>Cheſter</hi> for the Plaintiff ſhould be affirmed.</p>
                  <p>And that neither the Leaſe to <hi>Freer,</hi> nor that to <hi>Morley,</hi> was good to avoid the Plaintiffs Title.</p>
                  <p>As for the leaſe to <hi>Freer,</hi> it being a grant of a <hi>Reverſion</hi> nominally, and by Agreement of Parties, there being no <hi>Reverſion,</hi> becauſe no leaſe, at the time of the Grant, was <hi>in eſſe,</hi> either of <hi>Seatons</hi> or <hi>Rocheſters,</hi> upon a point of Raſure in <hi>Rocheſter's</hi> Demiſe found in the Caſe, and for that Land in poſſeſſion, could not paſs by the name of a <hi>Reverſion,</hi> though by the name of <hi>Land</hi> a <hi>Reverſion</hi> may paſs; for he who will grant <hi>Land</hi> in poſſeſſion, cannot be thought not to grant the ſame, if only in <hi>Reverſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. Chandoes Caſe, 6. Rep.</note> according to the doctrine of <hi>Throgmorton's</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Commentaries.</hi>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99478:51"/>
                  <p>And for that <hi>Morley's</hi> leaſe was to commence after the leaſe granted to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> which was to commence after that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Seaton</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>February, 27 H. 8.</hi> whereas no ſuch leaſe was granted to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> but a leaſe to commence after one granted to <hi>Seaton,</hi> in <hi>28 H. 8.</hi> It was reſolv'd, None of thoſe leaſes were <hi>in eſſe,</hi> and that <hi>Morley's</hi> leaſe commenced therefore preſently.</p>
                  <p>The words of the Reſolution are theſe, <hi>as to <hi>Morley</hi>'s Leaſe; It was Reſolv'd that <hi>Morley</hi>'s Leaſe was not <hi>in eſſe;</hi> for that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recites the former Leaſes, and ſo hath the ſame Rule as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, where it recites Leaſes and there be none ſuch; Therefore it ſhall begin from the Date, which being in the Fifteenth of the Queen, for Fifty years, ended 1623. which was before the Leaſe made to the Plaintiff; for theſe Reaſons Judgment was affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Concluſions are deducible from this leaſe to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> as from the former to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and therefore I will not repeat them: But here are <hi>two Judgments</hi> in the very point of our Caſe, and affirmed in a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> unanimouſly in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where it is thought material that the <hi>Jury</hi> have found a half years Rent to have been behind at <hi>Michaelmas, 1643.</hi> and thence inferr'd, the <hi>Jury</hi> have found the leaſes by which that Rent was aſcertain'd, namely, the leaſes of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely if a leaſe be for a term of years, to commence from the end of a former term, and for ſuch Rent as is reſerv'd upon ſuch former Demiſe that never was; as no term can commence from the end of another which never was, ſo no Rent can be behind, which cannot appear but by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was never made, that is, which is never found to be made.</p>
                  <p>Add further, That if the Iury had found the Leaſes of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> to have been made, as is mentioned in the leaſe of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> that had not been a ſufficient finding of them.</p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Deed</hi> is not found at all, nor a laſt Will, when only the <hi>Jury</hi> find but part of the Deed or Will, for the Court can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Iudge but upon the whole, and not upon part.</p>
                  <p>It it be found in <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> the Defendant was Tenant, and diſſeis'd the Plaintiff, <hi>niſi verba contenta in ultima voluntate W. M.</hi> give a lawful Eſtate from <hi>W.

                  </p>
                  <p>So for the ſame reaſon, finding but part of a <hi>recited Deed,</hi> and not the whole, is as if no part were found, and it appears by the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>1 Mariae,</hi> that both <hi>Deeds</hi> of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> are recited therein but in part; for after as much as is recited of either <hi>Deeds</hi> reſpectively is ſaid, <hi>as more plainly appears among other Grants and Covenants in the ſaid Deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if other Grants were in the <hi>Deed</hi> of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> beſides thoſe recited, then the expreſs Grant of the very <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton,</hi> might be one of thoſe Grants which is urg'd not to be granted, becauſe not recited in <hi>29 H. 8. nominally,</hi> and if ſo, here being two former demiſes of the <hi>Mannor</hi> mentioned in the Indenture <hi>1 Mar.</hi> and for different terms; the one <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> for <hi>Eighty</hi> years, the other <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> for <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> years, and ſo expiring at different terms, it is uncertain from which Expiration the demiſe of the <hi>Mannor 1 Mar.</hi> ſhall Commence, and conſequently the demiſe having no certain Commencement, will be void by the <hi>Rector of Chedington's Caſe, 1. Rep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But admitting the <hi>Mannor</hi> not demis'd by <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> yet the <hi>Jury</hi> finding the demiſe <hi>1 Mar. Habendum à fine prioris dimiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi> and not <hi>prioris dimiſſionis ejuſdem Manerii,</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſtill, Whether the <hi>Habendum à fine prioris dimiſſionis,</hi> as the <hi>Jury</hi> have found it, ſhall referr to the end of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> or to that of <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> both of them being <hi>prior demiſes</hi> mentioned in the Indenture <hi>1 Mar.</hi> for if only the demiſe <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> had been mentioned in that of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> the demiſe <hi>1 Mar.</hi> for its Commencement, muſt of neceſſity have referr'd to the Expiration of the demiſe by <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> though the <hi>Mannor</hi> paſs'd not by it, and it will not then change the uncertainty, becauſe the demiſe <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhall you, to this finding of the <hi>Jury,</hi> ſuppoſe a different finding from their finding barely the <hi>Indenture</hi> of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> call in aid any thing from the Recitals in <hi>1 Mar.</hi> and ſo make up a Medley Verdict, partly from what the <hi>Jury</hi> find expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and partly from what is only recited, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe found.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:99478:52"/>
                  <p>As for inſtance, The <hi>Jury</hi> find the <hi>Mannor</hi> demis'd for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, <hi>Habendum,</hi> from the end of a former demiſe mention'd <hi>1 Mar.</hi> This Verdict in it ſelf, finds no Commencement of the term, by not finding from the Expiration of which term it begins, nor find no Rent reſerv'd. But the demiſe of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> as to them, muſt be made out from the recitals of <hi>Deeds</hi> not found to be real, which is a way of confounding all Verdicts.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Jury</hi> ſay, The <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd <hi>à fine prioris dimiſſionis in Indentura predict. mentionat.</hi> for <hi>Ninety</hi> years, they do not ſay, <hi>à fine prioris dimiſſionis ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Manerii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as if nothing elſe were, the former <hi>Indenture</hi> mention'd might be of the <hi>Vicaridge,</hi> or any other thing, and not at all of the <hi>Mannor;</hi> and yet by the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> the demiſe of the <hi>Mannor</hi> was to Commence from the Expiration of ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer demiſe, whatever was demis'd by it.</p>
                  <p>But the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> demiſeth all the Premiſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the firſt Indenture, <hi>Habendum from the Expiration of the term.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> If the <hi>Mannor</hi> be not compris'd in the firſt Indenture, it cannot be demis'd by <hi>1 Mar.</hi> from the Expiration of the firſt term in the firſt Indenture.</p>
                  <p>But admitting this, Who can ſay the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is not compris'd in the firſt <hi>Indenture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, What if only part of the firſt Indenture is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not all, in the Deed of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> and ſo the <hi>Mannor</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the recital, though it were compris'd in the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> and perhaps the <hi>Jury</hi> might, if that Indenture were produc'd to them, ſee it was compris'd in the Indenture, though not recited to be ſo.</p>

                     <hi>4.</hi> How can it appear to us, but that the <hi>Jury</hi> did find the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton</hi> to be expreſly demis'd by the firſt Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if any thing were demis'd by it.</p>
                  <p>If then the <hi>Jury</hi> did conceive the <hi>Mannor</hi> of <hi>Hooknorton</hi> was demis'd by the firſt recited <hi>Indenture,</hi> as moſt probably they did:</p>
                  <p>When they find, That by the Indenture of <hi>1 Mar.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Mannor</hi> was convey'd <hi>à fine prioris dimiſſionis in Indentur. praedict. mentionat.</hi> And there are mentioned in the Indenture of <hi>1.

                  <p>But admit it ſhould be taken to Commence from the end of the term of <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> and not from the other, becauſe in that term (if any ſuch were) the <hi>Mannor</hi> is without ſcruple demis'd; yet we muſt remember, the preſent Queſtion is not of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> but of <hi>Two hundred Acres, parcel of the Mannor.</hi> And in the Leaſe of <hi>1 E. 6.</hi> though the <hi>Mannor</hi> be demis'd, yet there is an Exception of certain Lands and Tenements in the Town or Vill of <hi>Hooknorton,</hi> which <hi>Croker</hi> then held for certain years enduring.</p>
                  <p>How doth it appear, That the <hi>Two hundred Acres</hi> in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, were not thoſe Lands excepted out of the demiſe of <hi>1 Mariae?</hi> For though they were parcel of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> they might be ſeverally demis'd and excepted; and though it be found,<note place="margin">Cok.

                  <p>The Plaintiff taking, by <hi>proteſtation,</hi> that nothing alledg'd by the Defendant was true, <hi>Demurrs</hi> upon the Plea.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes offer'd to maintain the Demurrer, are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That one of the Iudgments pleaded in Barr obtain'd by <hi>William Allington</hi> in the Court of <hi>London,</hi> before the <hi>Mayor, &amp;c.</hi> againſt the Defendant for <hi>2670 l. 17 s. 7 d. </hi> due to the ſaid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> by the <hi>Inteſtate Everard,</hi> was not duly obtained, and is inſufficient to Barr the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99478:55"/>
                     <hi>2.</hi> That the Defendants <hi>ſpecial</hi> Plea in Barr appearing in any part of it to be falſe and inſufficient, the Plaintiff ought to have Iudgment for his whole debt.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> For the firſt Cauſe, it was urg'd as an Exception to the <hi>Defendants</hi> Plea, That by the Plea it appears, that time out of mind a Court hath been held in the City of <hi>London,</hi> before the Mayor and Aldermen, of all perſonal Actions ariſing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the ſaid City.</p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> was, at the time of his death, indebted to the ſaid <hi>Allington</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> within the Pariſh and Ward of St. <hi>Mary Bow</hi> and <hi>Cheapſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is not alledg'd, That the ſaid debt did ariſe and grow due in <hi>London,</hi> within the ſaid <hi>Pariſh</hi> and <hi>Ward;</hi> for whereſoever the debt did ariſe and grow due, yet the debtor is indebted to the creditor in any place where he is, as long as the debt is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to ſay, The <hi>Inteſtate</hi> was indebted to <hi>Allington</hi> in the ſaid Sum <hi>apud London, &amp;c.</hi> affirms not that the debt did ariſe and grow due at <hi>London;</hi> and if not, the Court had no Iuriſdiction of the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The effect of the <hi>Defendants</hi> Barr is only to ſhew, That ſuch a <hi>Judgment</hi> was obtain'd in ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> againſt him, and not to ſet forth the whole <hi>Record</hi> of obtaining it; for it were vaſt Expence of time and mony ſo to do, as often as occaſion is to mention a <hi>Record;</hi> and referrs to the <hi>Record, prout per Recordum plenius liquet,</hi> where the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> may take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any defect therein. But if that were neceſſary, it is well ſet forth; for his Plea is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Et praedictus <hi>Willielmus Allington</hi> tunc &amp; ibidem in eadem Curia ſecundum conſuetudinem Civitatis praedictae, affirmabat contra praedictum <hi>Rolandum Dee</hi> ut Adminiſtratorem, &amp;c. quandam billam originalem de placito debiti, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Cuſtome being to hold Plea of perſonal Actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing within the City, if he affirmed a Bill of Debt, according to the Cuſtome,</p>
                  <p>It muſt be of a debt ariſing and growing due within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> A ſecond Exception was, That it is not ſet forth for what the debt was, whereby the Court may judge whether it were payable or not by the Adminiſtrator.</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99478:55"/>
                  <p>To this it was anſwer'd, That the courſe in <hi>London</hi> is for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to declare that the Debtor being indebted to him at ſuch a time and place, <hi>Conceſſit ſolvere,</hi> ſuch a Sum to him, at ſuch a time, for they enter not there at large, as at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> all the pleading; and the <hi>City Cuſtomes</hi> have been often confirmed by Parliament, and <hi>if Exception be taken to the Juriſdiction, it muſt come from the Defendant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However that will not avoid the Iudgment, and is but Error.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> A third Exception was, It is not ſet forth that the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> was indebted to <hi>Allington</hi> in his own right.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt be intended if he were indebted to him by Law, that it was in his own right.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> A fourth Exception was, That the <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the <hi>Plaintiff, quod recuperaret debitum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum;</hi> where the Iudgment ſhould be <hi>quod recuperet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not the <hi>Defendants</hi> concern to recite the words of the Iudgment, as it was given by the Court, but the effect of it rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and ſo it is more proper to ſay Iudgment was given <hi>quod recuperaret.</hi> The Court ſay, <hi>ideo conſideratum eſt per Curiam;</hi> but he who relates what they did, ſaith, <hi>ideo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratum fuit per Curiam.</hi> But my Book is <hi>quod recuperet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> A fifth Exception was, That the Plea ſets forth the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was brought againſt the <hi>Defendant Dee</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator</hi> of the <hi>Inteſtate,</hi> omitting <hi>durante minori aetate Caroli E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard filii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That will not avoid the Iudgment,<note place="margin">Rolls, Good &amp; Pincents Caſe, Tit. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors f. 910. 14 Car. 1. B.R. Piggots Caſe, 5 Rep.</note> though the <hi>Minor</hi> were of Age ſufficient to adminiſter himſelf; nor is it of prejudice to any, as was reſolved in the Caſe of one <hi>Pincent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if an <hi>Adminiſtrator, durante minori aetate,</hi> brings an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt averr the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> or <hi>Executor</hi> to be under the Age of <hi>Seventeen</hi> years.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6. Sixthly,</hi> it was urg'd as reſolv'd in <hi>Turners</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">Turners Caſe 8. Rep. f. 132.</note> That the Recital of <hi>Allingtons</hi> Declaration in <hi>London,</hi> not mentioning the Debt to be <hi>per ſcriptum obligatorium,</hi> it ſhall not be intended to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>And it was urg'd as reſolv'd in that Caſe of <hi>Turner</hi> alſo, That it being a Debt but by ſimple Contract, the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> was not chargeable with it.</p>
                  <p>That is a Reſolution in <hi>Turners</hi> Caſe ſupernumerary, and not neceſſary to ſupport the Iudgment given, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Iudicial <hi>Reſolution</hi> for the Iudgment given in <hi>Turners</hi> Caſe was well given, becauſe the Iudgments given before the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Ciceſter,</hi> pleaded in barr of the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Action
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99478:56"/> were reſolv'd to be <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> becauſe it appear'd not that the Mayor of <hi>Ciceſter</hi> had any Iuriſdiction to hold Plea by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> or <hi>Preſcription.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But admitting that an <hi>Executor</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Reſolution, is not chargeable (if by chargeable be meant compellable) at the <hi>Common Law</hi> in an Action of Debt brought upon a ſimple Contract of the <hi>Teſtator</hi> or <hi>Inteſtate,</hi> to pay ſuch Debt; what would it avail the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in that Caſe, or can in this Caſe, unleſs the Reſolution had been, That though the Iuriſdiction of the Court of <hi>Ciceſter</hi> had been well ſet forth, yet a Iudgment there obtain'd againſt the <hi>Executor,</hi> upon a ſimple Contract of the <hi>Teſtators,</hi> had been no Barr in an Action of Debt brought upon an Obligation of the <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> (But there is no ſuch Reſolution there) for a Iudgment obtain'd upon ſuch a ſimple Contract, is as much a Iudgment when had, as any other, upon Obligations, and the <hi>Books</hi> and uſe are clear, That <hi>Judgments</hi> muſt be ſatisfied before <hi>Debts</hi> due by Obligation. It is true, it is a <hi>Waſte</hi> of the Goods of the Dead in the <hi>Executor, to pay voluntarily a Debt by ſimple Contract before a Debt by Obligation</hi> whereof he had notice (and not otherwiſe) in that Caſe. But no man ever thought it a <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> in the <hi>Executor,</hi> to ſatisfie a Iudgment obtain'd upon a ſimple Contract, before a Debt due by Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Yet I ſhall agree, the <hi>Executor</hi> by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> might have prevented this Iudgment, by abating the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Writ at firſt, which he had power lawfully to do, but he had <hi>equal</hi> power lawfully not to abate it, and us'd that laſt lawful power, and not the firſt, and wrong'd none in uſing it.</p>
                  <p>To this may be added, That the Iudgment upon a ſimple Contract is the Act of the Court, and compulſory to the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> and he hath then no Election, but muſt obey the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In concluſion though it were agreed, That in the Action of Debt brought by <hi>Allington</hi> upon a ſimple Contract, Iudgment ought not to have been given againſt the Defendant being <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator,</hi> but the Writ ſhould have abated, becauſe the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator</hi> was not chargeable. And though the Iudgment given were erroneous, and for that cauſe reverſible, yet ſtanding in force unrevers'd; It is a good Barr to the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Action.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:99478:56"/>
                  <p>But leſt this ſhould countenance Iudges abating the Writ <hi>ex officio,</hi> in ſuch Actions brought, or <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> to bring <hi>Error</hi> upon Iudgments given in ſuch Actions, I conceive the Law is clear, That Iudges ought not, <hi>ex officio,</hi> to abate ſuch Writ, nor otherwiſe than when the <hi>Executor</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrator, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> in ſuch Action <hi>demurrs,</hi> and <hi>demands Judgment</hi> of the Writ, and that Iudgment given againſt ſuch <hi>Defendants</hi> not demurring to the Writ, is not <hi>Erroneous,</hi> unleſs for other cauſe.</p>
                  <p>If it be urg'd further, That though a Iudgment obtain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſimple Contract, be a barr to an Action of Debt brought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon an Obligation, or to an Action of the Caſe upon an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit</hi> to pay mony, as the preſent Caſe is.</p>
                  <p>Yet it ſhould not barr, if the Action upon which it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, were commenc'd pending a former Action upon an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or upon an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> for mony, in which the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> could not have waged his Law.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer is as before, ſuch Iudgment barrs until revers'd, if admitted to be reverſible; as it is not.</p>
                  <p>But the Law is ſetled, <hi>That whereſoever an Action of Debt, upon Bond or Contract, is brought againſt a man, he may lawfully confeſs the Action, and give way to a Judgment, if there be no fraud in the Caſe, although he have perfect notice of ſuch former Suit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending;</hi> nor is there any reſtraint or limit of time for confeſſing an Action brought upon a <hi>ſimple Contract,</hi> more than upon a <hi>Bond.</hi>

                  <p>It will be ſtill objected, That if the Law be that <hi>Executors</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> may pay debts upon ſimple Contracts of the deceas'd, to which they are not bound, and thereby prevent the payment of a debt to which they are bound; It is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reaſon, and conſequently cannot be Law; for that is in effect, at the ſame time to be bound, and not bound to pay: For he who may not pay being bound, is not bound at all. For clearing this we muſt know,</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Executors</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> are not compell'd by the Common Law to anſwer Actions of Debt for <hi>ſimple Contracts,</hi> yet the Law of the <hi>Land</hi> obligeth payment of them. For,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And as this was the ancient Law and practiſe before in the Spiritual Court, ſo by the new Act in <hi>22</hi> and <hi>23</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> for the better ſettling of <hi>Inteſtates</hi> Eſtates, <hi>It is enacted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that upon the Adminiſtrators accompt, deductions be made of all ſorts of debts.</hi>

                  <p>And if ſuch Debts were not juſtly to be ſo demanded and paid, it had been againſt the Iudges Oath to paſs ſuch Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the <hi>Defendant</hi> is not bound to Demurr, but leaves the Iuſtice of the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> demand to the Court.</p>

                     <note place="margin">10 H. 6. f. 24. b. 25. a.</note> who gave the Rule in the Caſe in queſtion, hath theſe words; <hi>The Law will not charge Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with a duty due by a ſimple Contract made by the Teſtator.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here is not only his own Opinion, but a Iudgment by him cited in that Court formerly in the point.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add another Caſe to this purpoſe. A man brought a <hi>Writ of Debt</hi> againſt another,<note place="margin">15 E. 4. f. 29. 2.</note> and <hi>counted</hi> that he ſold certain Goods to his <hi>Teſtator</hi> for the Sum in demand. <hi>Littleton</hi> caus'd the <hi>Attorney</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> (as printed) but ſhould be <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> to be demanded, and ſo he was; and <hi>Littleton</hi> demanded
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99478:58"/> of him, <hi>Si'l voyl avoyder ſon Suite,</hi> not his own, but his who counted againſt him <hi>que dit que voyl,</hi> and after <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Attorney</hi> of the Plaintiff, The Court awards, that you take nothing by the Writ; for know, that a man ſhall never have an Action againſt <hi>Executors,</hi> where the <hi>Teſtator</hi> might have wag'd his Law, in his life time, <hi>quod nota.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was not proper to ask the <hi>Plaintiffs Attorney,</hi> Whether he would avoid his <hi>Clyents</hi> Suit, and an unlikely anſwer of his to ſay, <hi>Yes;</hi> but a rational demand to the <hi>Defendants Attorney,</hi> Whether he would avoid his Suit who counted againſt him? and probably he ſhould anſwer <hi>Yes;</hi> and after <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Attorney</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> the Court awards you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by your Writ: If he had been the perſon to whom the queſtion was firſt asked, and who immediately before had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>Yes;</hi> the Book had not been that after <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Attorney</hi> of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> but that <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaid to him who was the ſame he diſcours'd with.</p>
                  <p>The Print thus rectified, this Caſe agrees with the Law deliver'd by <hi>Cotſmore.</hi> An <hi>Executor</hi> is ſued, and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in Court, for ſo was the Courſe then, upon a ſimple Contract of his <hi>Teſtators,</hi> the Iudge asks his <hi>Attorney,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had a mind to avoid the Suit? who anſwer'd, <hi>Yes.</hi> If the Iudge had thought fit, he might have avoided the Suit without making any queſtion, but knowing it was not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Law to avoid a Suit upon a ſimple Contract, unleſs the <hi>Executor</hi> himſelf deſired it; He therefore asked him the Queſtion, and finding he did deſire it; the Iudge preſently told the <hi>Plaintiffs Attorney,</hi> He could take nothing by the Writ. Elſe you ſee the Conſequence of this Iudgment, That the Iudges, <hi>ex officio,</hi> ſhould prevent any Iudgment for the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> in Debt, brought upon a ſimple Contract againſt an <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> whether the <hi>Executor</hi> would or not, againſt former and ſubſequent uſage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brook</hi> in <hi>Abridging</hi> this Caſe, and not reflecting upon it rightly, abridges it, that <hi>Littleton</hi> demanded the <hi>Plaintiffs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,</hi> If he would avow his Suit; whereas the word is clearly <hi>avoid,</hi> not <hi>avow:</hi> and to what purpoſe ſhould he ask that <hi>Queſtion;</hi> for ſure it was avow'd as much as could be, when counted upon at the inſtant in <hi>Court.</hi>

                  <p>But agreed, That the <hi>Executor</hi> confeſſing the Action or pleading, <hi>nil debet,</hi> in ſuch Caſe, and that found againſt him, he hath no remedy.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This being the ſame Caſe with the former, the reaſon of the Iudgment was the ſame of grounding an Action upon a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty not good in Law.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it appears in the latter Caſe, the <hi>Executor</hi> oppoſed the Action by offering to demurr, and for any thing appearing, he did ſo in the firſt.</p>

                  <p>So as when the <hi>Executor</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> hath once pleaded to an Action of Debt, upon a ſingle Contract, he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bound up for the event, as in any Action wherein the <hi>Teſtator</hi> or <hi>Inteſtate</hi> could not have waged Law.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore an ill Conſequence for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to ſay, I have brought an Action upon a ſimple Contract, wherein the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> could not have waged his Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I muſt be paid before another Creditor, by ſimple Contract, bringing an Action wherein the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> might wage his Law, for it is in the <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> power, by omitting to abate the Writ at firſt, to make the Debt demanded by Action in which the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> might have waged his Law, to be as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and coercively paid, as the other Debt demanded by Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he could not wage his Law.</p>
                  <p>And if the <hi>Executor</hi> believes the Debt by ſimple Contract demanded by Action of Debt to be a juſt Debt, it is againſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, conſcience, and the duty of his Office to demurr, whereby to delay, or prevent the payment of it.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:99478:59"/>
                  <p>Beſides, though ſince that illegal Reſolution of <hi>Slade's</hi> Caſe, grounded upon Reaſons not fit for a <hi>Declamation,</hi> much leſs for a <hi>Deciſion of Law,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The natural and genuine Action of Debt, upon a ſimple Contract, be turned into an Action of the Caſe, wherein a man is deprived of waging his Law; It is an abſurd Opinion, to think that therefore Debt demanded by it, ought to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency for payment of a Debt due by <hi>ſimple Contract,</hi> but quite the contrary.</p>
                  <p>For Actions of the Caſe are all <hi>Actiones injuriarum, &amp; contra pacem,</hi> and it is not a Debt certain, in reaſon of Law, that can be recovered by thoſe Actions, but damage for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enſuing upon the breach of promiſe, which cannot be known until a Iury aſcertain what the damage is: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man did never wage his Law for a demand incertain; for he could not make Oath of paying that, which he knew not what it was, as conſiſting in damage.</p>
                  <p>Now although the Iury give in damages regularly, the money promiſed to be paid, yet that changeth not the reaſon of the Law, nor the form, for ſtill it is recovered by way of damage, and not as a Debt is recovered.</p>
                  <p>Which ſhew the Action much inferiour and ignobler than the <hi>Action of Debt,</hi> which by the <hi>Regiſter</hi> is an Action of <hi>property,</hi> and no reaſon a damage uncertain in its own nature ſhould be paid before a certain Debt by <hi>ſimple Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> which were the firſt Debts, and will probably be the laſt of the World, for Contracts by writing were much later; and there are many Nations yet, where <hi>Letters</hi> are unknown, and perhaps ever will be.</p>
                  <p>And that which is ſo commonly now received, That every Contract executory implies a promiſe, is a falſe Gloſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to turn <hi>Actions of Debt</hi> into <hi>Actions on the Caſe:</hi> For Contracts of Debt are reciprocal Grants.

                  <p>So as it appears, The <hi>Recognizance</hi> was taken before the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and that the <hi>Conuzor</hi> was to incurr the penalty of the <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> was there intended to be pleaded, but it was not pleaded that it was taken <hi>ſecundum formam Statuti</hi> in general, nor ſpecially <hi>per ſcriptum Obligatorium</hi> under Seal, as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>But here it is not pleaded, That the <hi>Conuzor</hi> was to incurr the penalty of the <hi>Statute Staple;</hi> nor that it was taken before any perſon authorized to take a <hi>Recognizance</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>23 H. 8. c. 6.</hi> for the <hi>Chancellor</hi> is not ſo authorized.</p>
                  <p>But that it was a bare <hi>Recognizance</hi> entred into in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which all <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have power to take, and that it remains there inroll'd. And that the ſaid Sum of <hi>Two thouſand pounds</hi> ſhould, for default of payment, be levied of the <hi>Conuzors</hi> Lands, Goods, and Chattels, and Execution of ſuch <hi>Recognizances</hi> are to be made by <hi>Elegit</hi> of the <hi>Lands</hi> as well as <hi>Goods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it appears by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Acton Burnell 13 E. 1.</hi> which is the Law for the <hi>Statute Merchant,</hi> That ſuch <hi>Recognizances</hi> for Debt were before the <hi>Statute Merchants</hi> taken by the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>Chief Juſtices,</hi> and <hi>Judges Itinerant,</hi> but the Execution of them not the ſame as of the <hi>Statute Merchant,</hi> nor are they hindered by that Statute from being as before expreſly.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Turners Caſe 8.

                     <hi>But in this Caſe, the Defendant hath pleaded payment of ſeveral Bonds, Bills, and Judgments, and pleads one Recognizance of</hi> 2000 <hi> l. and one Judgment of</hi> 7000 <hi> l. wholly unſatisfied, and concludes his Plea with plene adminiſtravit.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now upon this Plea, if <hi>Allington's</hi> Iudgment of 2670 <hi>l.</hi> or the Statute of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> or both, be avoided, yet the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath no right to be paid, until the Iudgment of 7000 <hi>l.</hi> be ſo ſatisfied, and that ſome aſſets remain after the ſatisfaction of it in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators</hi> hands, for before the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath no wrong, nor the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> doth none, nor hath any benefit by not ſatisfying the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſpungy Reaſon that the <hi>Defendants</hi> Plea is all intire, and therefore if any part be falſe, as either in that of <hi>Allington's</hi> Iudgment, or the <hi>Recognizance,</hi> the Plea is bad, is not ſenſe; for if the falſhood be neither hurtful to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> nor benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the <hi>Defendant;</hi> why ſhould the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> have what he ought not, or the <hi>Defendant</hi> pay what he ought not.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded a Iudgment obtain'd againſt the <hi>Inteſtate,</hi> or himſelf, and that the <hi>Inteſtate</hi> or himſelf were married at the time of the Iudgment obtain'd (which in truth

                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the uſual pleading, as appears both by <hi>Turners</hi> and <hi>Treſhams</hi> Caſe, is that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> muſt avoid all payments pleaded in barr, until ſome aſſets appear in the <hi>Adminiſtrators</hi> hands remaining, and then he is to have Iudgment.</p>
                  <p>Much noiſe hath been about this Caſe, and without Reaſon, as I ſuppoſe, though there were no precedent Iudgment in the point, but there is a <hi>Judgment per Curiam.</hi>

               <p>After King <hi>James</hi> made a Leaſe of the <hi>Four Cloſes</hi> call'd <hi>Northdrocumbs,</hi> or <hi>Drocumbs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gennings verſus Lake, 5 Car. 1. Crook 168.</note> and upon queſtion between the Queens Patentee and the Kings, Iudgment was given for the <hi>Queens Patentee:</hi> Becauſe, though the Houſe was newly erected before the Queens Grant, yet the Land ſhall be ſaid belonging to it, and it ſhall paſs by ſuch name as it was known at the time of the Patent; and that was a ſtronger Caſe than this, there being but <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> years to give <hi>Reputation</hi> of belonging or appertaining.</p>
               <p>Another meaning of the words <hi>belonging or appertaining,</hi> is, when they relate not to the extent or largeneſs of the Grant, but to the nature of the thing granted. As if a man newly erect a Mill in ſtructure, and hath no Water-courſe to it, if he grants his Mill with the Appurtenances, nothing paſſes but the ſtructure. But if he, after the ſtructure, acquire or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Water-courſe to it, and grant it with the Appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Water-courſe paſſes, becauſe the Mill cannot be uſed without it. So it is for the Mill-damm or Bank, or the like. So if he acquire an inlargement or bettering of his Water-courſe, that additional water ſhall paſs as pertaining, how late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever acquired.</p>
               <p>So if a man grants his Saddle, with all things thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, <hi>Stirrops, Girths,</hi> and the like paſs.</p>
               <p>So if a man will grant his <hi>Viol,</hi> the <hi>Strings</hi> and <hi>Bow</hi> will paſs.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Pool</hi> was belonging and appertaining to the Water-work in this laſt ſenſe, as pertaining to the nature of the thing granted, without which it could not be us'd; for the Iury find,</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:99478:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quod Stagnum praedictum fuit neceſſarium pro ſtructura (Anglicè</hi> Water-work) <hi>praedict. quodque eadem ſtructura ſine eodem Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no operare non potuit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where a thing is ſo pertaining to the nature of the thing granted, it is belonging and pertaining immediately as ſoon as the thing is erected, and it is annexed to it.</p>
               <p>And note, the Iury do not find that <hi>aqua Stagni praedict.</hi> but the <hi>Stagnum</hi> it ſelf, was neceſſary for the Water-work. Nor do they find that the Water-work could not <hi>operare ſine aqua Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> but <hi>ſine Stagno praedict.</hi> And thereby they find that the Water and Soyl, which <hi>Stagnum</hi> ſignifies, was neceſſary for the work, and it could not work without it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The words of the Act of 21 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 12. and which are particularly found by the Iury, are</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if any Action, Bill, Plaint, or Suit upon the Caſe, Treſpaſs, Beating, or Falſe Impriſonment, ſhall be brought againſt any Juſtice of the Peace, Mayor, or Bayliff of City, or Town Corporate, Headborough, Portreeve, Conſtable, Tithingman, &amp;c. or any of them, or any other, which in their Aid or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

That the ſaid Action, Bill, Plaint, or Suit, ſhall be laid within the County where the Treſpaſs or Fact ſhall be done and committed, and not elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that it ſhall be lawful to every perſon and perſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to plead the general Iſſue, and to give the ſpecial matter in evidence. As by the Act of 7 Jac. cap. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if upon the Tryal of any ſuch Action, Bill, Plaint, or Suit, the Plaintiff therein ſhall not prove to the Jury, Treſpaſs, Beating, Impriſonment, or other Fact or cauſe of Action, Bill, Plaint, &amp;c. was or were had, made, or committed within the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein ſuch Action, Bill, Plaint, or Suit, ſhall be laid, That then the Jury ſhall find the Defendant or Defendants, in every ſuch Action, Bill, Plaint, or Suit, Not guilty, without having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard or reſpect to any Evidence given by the Plaintiff touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treſpaſs, or other cauſe of the Action, Bill, Plaint or Suit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Verdict ſhall paſs with the Defendant or Defendants, or if the Plaintiff therein become Non-ſuit, or ſuffer any diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof, the Defendant or Defendants, ſhall have ſuch double Coſts and other Advantages, as by the Act of 7 Jac. cap. 5. is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>The firſt Queſtion upon this <hi>Special Verdict,</hi> is</p>
               <p>Whether if any Officer in the Act mentioned, or any in his aſſiſtance, ſhall do things, by colour of their Office, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or concerning their ſaid Office, and ſhall be therefore impleaded? Or if they, or any of them ſhall be impleaded for or concerning any matter, cauſe, or thing by them, or any of them, done by pretence of their Offices, and which is not ſtrictly done by virtue or reaſon of their Office, but is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſance in Law, ſhall have the benefit of this Act, of having the matter tryed in the County where the Fact was done, and not elſewhere?</p>
               <p>If ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> They ſhall not have the Tryal for any matter touching their Offices in the County where the Fact was done, unleſs the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99478:66"/> 
                  <hi>Plaintiff</hi> pleaſe to lay it there, and if he ſo pleas'd, it might have been laid there before the Act of <hi>21.</hi> which was purpoſely made to compel the laying of the Action where the Fact was done.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> By ſuch Expoſition of the Act, the Action ſhall never be laid where the Fact was done; for if it may be laid elſewhere at all, if it be found upon the <hi>Tryal,</hi> That the Officers queſtion'd did not according to their Office, there will be no cauſe to lay the Action in the proper County; for the Iury where the Action is laid, will find for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> for the <hi>Misfeazance;</hi> and if it be found the <hi>Defendants</hi> have purſued their Office, wherever the Action is laid, the Iury will find for the <hi>Defendants,</hi> and then no cauſe to lay an Action in the County where the Fact was done; So <hi>Quacunque via data,</hi> the Act will be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> If it can be laid in another County, without hearing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it cannot be known whether the Officer hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, or not. How then can the Iury (as the Act directs) find the <hi>Defendants</hi> Not guilty, without regard or reſpect to the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Evidence; for then the Iury muſt regard the Evidence, to find whether the Officer hath miſ-done, and not regard the Evidence at all, to find the Officers Not guilty, as the Act doth order.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any inconvenience, becauſe by the Intention of <hi>Law,</hi> whether the Officers have done juſtifiably, or not, without this Act of <hi>21.</hi> the Action ought to be laid where the Fact was done; and the Act is but to compel the doing of that where an Officer is concerned, that otherwiſe <hi>fieri debuit,</hi> though <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum valet</hi> not being done.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, Whether upon the ſpecial points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Court by the Iury, they have found all the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> or any of them, and whom, Not guilty?</p>
               <p>It hath been admitted at the Barr, That the <hi>Defendants,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Sir <hi>Richard Coxe,</hi> cannot be found culpable by this Act of <hi>21.</hi> and it being a Treſpaſs, that ſome may be guilty, and not others; which is true.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is not, Whether ſome of the <hi>Defendants</hi> might have been found guilty, and others not? but whether, as this Verdict is, all or none muſt be Culpable.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The Iury referr to the Court, <hi>Si actio praedicta potuit commenſari in London,</hi> then they find all the <hi>Defendants</hi> culpable. And if <hi>actio praedicta potuit commenſari tantummodo</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> then they find all the <hi>Defendants</hi> by name, <hi>Not Culpable.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:99478:66"/>
               <p>So as the matter is, Whether this individual Action brought joyntly againſt all the <hi>Defendants,</hi> might be laid in <hi>London?</hi> For that is the <hi>Actio praedicta,</hi> not whether an Action might be laid in <hi>London</hi> for the Treſpaſs againſt any of theſe <hi>Defendants?</hi> and in that firſt ſenſe, <hi>Actio praedicta,</hi> could not be in <hi>London;</hi> for it could not be there laid, as to ſome of the <hi>Defendants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Secondly, they referr to the Court, Whether <hi>Actio prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta,</hi> which is this Action, jointly brought againſt all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants,</hi> could only be laid in the County of <hi>Glouceſter;</hi> and if ſo, they find for the <hi>Defendants;</hi> to which the Court muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That this Action, ſo jointly brought, could only be laid according to Law, <hi>ad omnem Juris effectum,</hi> in the County of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, if the <hi>Court</hi> ſhould be of Opinion, That the Action was well laid, as to Sir <hi>Richard Coxe,</hi> but not the reſt, the Iury find not him Guilty, and not the reſt; for they find all equally Guilty, or equally not Guilty.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> Fourthly, That which differs his Caſe from the reſt, is, That he was not aſſiſtant or aiding to the <hi>Conſtable;</hi> for he bad, that is, <hi>praecepit,</hi> or commanded the <hi>Conſtable</hi> to put the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> in <hi>Cippis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to that, the ancient Law was both adjudg'd in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and allowed, That it was <hi>contra conſuetudinem Regni,</hi> that a man ſhould be condemn'd in a Treſpaſs, <hi>De praecepto</hi> or <hi>auxilio,</hi> if no man were <hi>convicted</hi> of the Fact done.</p>
               <p>It was the Caſe in <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Bogo de Clare, 18 E. 1. John Wallis</hi> Clerk, entred his Houſe, and brought <hi>Letters</hi> of Citation from the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> Some of the Family of <hi>Bogo</hi> made <hi>Wallis</hi> eat the ſaid <hi>Proceſs</hi> and <hi>Wax</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to affixed, <hi>Et impriſonaverunt &amp; male tractaverunt:</hi> For which, and the Contempt to the King, he brought his Action againſt <hi>Bogo;</hi> who pleaded, That he named no perſons in certain, nor alledg'd that the Fact was done by his command, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iudgment thereupon, and was diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, by the Kings pleaſure, for ſo enormous a Treſpaſs, done in Contempt of the <hi>Church,</hi> for the Contempt done within the Verge, and in time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and for the bad Example,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bogo</hi> was commanded to anſwer the King of the <hi>Treſpaſs done</hi> in his Houſe, <hi>Et per Manupaſtos &amp; Familiares ſuos;</hi> and a day given him to produce before the King and his Council, thoſe of his Family: which was accordingly done, but they who were ſaid to have done the Fact, were fled.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:99478:67"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Et ſuper hoc idem <hi>Bogo</hi> perit Judicium, ſi de Praecepto, miſſione vel aſſenſu, ſi ſibi imponeretur ad ſectam Domini Regis reſpondere debeat, antequam factores principales, aliquo modo de facto illo convincantur.</hi> Whereupon Iudgment was given. <hi>Et quia per conſuetudinem &amp; legem <hi>Angliae,</hi> Nullus de praecepto vi &amp; auxilio aut miſſione reſpondere debeat antequam factores aliquo modo convincantur; Conſideratum eſt quod praedictus <hi>Bogo</hi> ad praeſens eat inde ſinedie, &amp; praedictus <hi>Jo. le Wallis</hi> ſequatur verſus factores principales prout ſibi viderit expediri ſi voluerit, &amp;</hi> ſix perſons <hi>manuceperunt praedictum <hi>Bogonem</hi> ad habendum ipſum coram Domino Rege ad reſpondendum ipſi Domino Regi ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem ſuam, cum praedicti factores de facto illo fuerint convicti, ſi Dominus Rex verſus eum inde loqui voluerit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Iudgment in Parliament, at the Kings Suit, That it was againſt the Cuſtome and Law of the Kingdom, to convict a man, <hi>de praecepto, auxilio, aut miſſione,</hi> in a Treſpaſs, before ſome, who did the principal Treſpaſs, were convicted.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon of that Law is very preſſing, for elſe a man may be found Culpable of aiding or <hi>precepting</hi> a Treſpaſs to be done, when the doers of the Treſpaſs are acquitted, and not Culpable, which is to be Culpable of aiding the doing of a thing never done, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, The Law in that Caſe is ſince alter'd, and otherwiſe practis'd. But who could alter a Law affirm'd by <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be the Cuſtome and Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, without an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to alter it, which was not; or at leaſt an Error in another <hi>Parliament,</hi> if that might be, which is not ſo clear.</p>
               <p>For this is not like a <hi>Judgment</hi> given in one Court, and after contraried in another, or in the <hi>Chequer Chamber.</hi> Any Law of the Kingdom might as well be alter'd without <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as this:</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5.</hi> However letting that paſs; but as the Law is now taken, no man can be guilty of aid or aſſiſtance to a Treſpaſs not done, and which is the ſame whereof the Actors are acquitted.</p>
               <p>But in this Caſe, They that put the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in the Stocks are found not Guilty, and another <hi>Defendant</hi> found Guilty for bidding him be put in the Stocks.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6.</hi> Another reaſon is, That <hi>Coxe</hi> cannot be Culpable of a Treſpaſs, which cannot, or muſt not be proved (which is the ſame) But by the Statute no regard or reſpect is to be had of the Evidence proving the Treſpaſs, if the Fact be not proved to be done where the Action is laid: Therefore there can be no
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99478:67"/> Evidence againſt <hi>Coxe, for Evidence not to be regarded, and not at all, is the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">

               <p>All Covenants between a <hi>Leſſor</hi> and his <hi>Leſſee,</hi> are either Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants in Law, or Expreſs Covenants.</p>

But if a ſtranger, who hath no right, outs the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> then he ſhall not have a <hi>Writ of Covenant</hi> againſt the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> becauſe he hath remedy by Action againſt the ſtranger; but if a ſtranger enter by <hi>elder Title,</hi> then he ſhall have a <hi>Writ of Covenant,</hi> for he hath no other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>This ſhews the Law gives not Remedy to the <hi>Leſſee</hi> upon the Covenant, when he hath a proper and natural Remedy againſt another who doth the wrong.</p>
               <p>By the ſame Reaſon, if the <hi>Leſſee</hi> be by expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> to enjoy his term (or enjoy it againſt all men, which is the ſame) he ſhall not have an <hi>Action of Covenant</hi> againſt the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> unleſs he be legally outed or evicted: For if he be outed tortiouſly by any ſtranger, he hath his Remedy.</p>
               <p>So is the expreſs Book of <hi>26 H. 6. f. 3. b.</hi> where it is agreed, That the <hi>warranty</hi> of a Leaſe for years, is but an <hi>Action of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> which extends not to tortious Entries for the former Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Yet I agree, If the <hi>Leſſor</hi> expreſly Covenants that the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall hold and enjoy his term without the Entry or Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, whether ſuch Entry or Interruption be lawful or tortious? There the <hi>Leſſor</hi> ſhall be charg'd by an <hi>Action of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> for the tortious Entry of a ſtranger, becauſe no other meaning can be given to his <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly the new Authorities run grounded upon that ſound and ancient Reaſon of Law, That the <hi>Leſſor</hi> ſhall not be charg'd with an Action upon his expreſs Covenant for enjoyment of the term againſt all men, where the <hi>Leſſee</hi> hath his proper Remedy againſt the wrong doer.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Truth there is one <hi>Book</hi> that hath, or may be pretended, which I will cite in the firſt place, becauſe the Anſwer to it may be more perſpicuous from the Authority I ſhall after deliver to redargue that Caſe.</p>

                  <head>Application of the Reaſon of Law to the Caſe in Queſtion.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. When a man Covenants his <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall enjoy his term a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all men, he doth neither expreſly covenant for his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt tortious Acts, nor doth the Law ſo interpret his Covenant.</p>
                  <p>So here, when the <hi>Leſſor</hi> Covenants the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall enjoy againſt his Aſſigns, he doth not covenant expreſly againſt their tortious acts, nor ought the Law to interpret that he doth, more than in the other Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is as unreaſonable he ſhould Covenant againſt the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Entries of his Aſſigns, as againſt the tortious Entries of all other ſtrangers; For he hath no proſpect, who of his Aſſigns may wrongfully Eject his <hi>Leſſee,</hi> more than what other ſtranger may do it, nor any power to prevent the tort of the one, more than of the other, as being equally unknown to him. Nor is there any ſenſible difference to be found, where a man Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants his <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall enjoy quietly againſt all the <hi>Johns</hi> and all the <hi>Thomaſſes</hi> in the world, than where againſt all men; for though the one Covenant be narrower than the other, yet the <hi>Covenantor</hi> can no more prevent the wrongs may be done by the <hi>Johns</hi> and <hi>Thomaſſes,</hi> than he can the wrongs may be done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man: Nor can the <hi>Covenantee</hi> fear more a wrong to be done by them, than by any other perſon not ſo named.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Aſſignee of the <hi>Leſſor</hi> enters tortiouſly upon the <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,</hi> he hath his proper and natural Remedy equally againſt him, as againſt any other ſtranger that ſo doth.</p>

                  <p>So as by all the Authorities cited by all the Reaſons of Law anciently and modernly, and by the particular words of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> in queſtion, the <hi>Defendant</hi> cannot be charg'd with breach of his <hi>Covenant</hi> for the tortious Entry of his <hi>Aſſignee</hi> upon the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

                  <head>The Difference between this Covenant and a general Covenant againſt all men.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid this is not a general Covenant to enjoy againſt all men, wherein the Law is clear, but rather a Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt particular men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is Authority, That if a man <hi>Covenant</hi> for qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Enjoyment againſt a particular perſon, that <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the tortious, as well as legal Entries, of ſuch particular perſon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Covenant</hi> in queſtion is no particular <hi>Covenant,</hi> though it be not the moſt general; no more is a <hi>Covenant</hi> to enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all of the names of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> or againſt all men now living, or againſt all claiming under the Covenantor, yet no man conceives it more rational to charge the <hi>Covenantor</hi> for tortious Entries done by ſuch, than for the tortious Entries of men of any other name. And it is as uncertain to the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or</hi> and <hi>Covenantee,</hi> who, are Aſſignees; or what Aſſignee of the <hi>Leſſor</hi> will make a tortious Entry, as what other man will do it.</p>
                  <p>But not ſo of a particular perſon, who is in the <hi>Covenantors</hi> proſpect, to prevent, and the <hi>Covenantees</hi> to fear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a <hi>Covenant</hi> for Enjoyment againſt all men, a man <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi> for enjoyment againſt <hi>himſelf, Executors, Adminiſtrators and Aſſigns</hi> (for they are a part of all men) but not againſt <hi>their tortious Entries,</hi> more than againſt all other mens <hi>tortious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man <hi>Covenant</hi> for enjoyment againſt his <hi>Executors, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators, and Aſſigns,</hi> and all others, it is not a different <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> from that of enjoyment againſt all men; for a mans <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors, Adminiſtrators, and Aſſigns,</hi> and all others, are all men.</p>
                  <p>So if a man <hi>Covenants</hi> for enjoyment againſt <hi>A. B. and C.</hi> and all others, it is the ſame as to <hi>Covenant</hi> for enjoyment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all men; for <hi>A. B. and C.</hi> and all others, are all men: Therefore that difference that this is not a general <hi>Covenant,</hi> is, <hi>Differentia ſoni non ponderis,</hi> and hath no reaſon of Law to diverſitie it from a general <hi>Covenant.</hi>

                  <head>Objections.</head>
                  <p>It was ſmartly objected by my Brother <hi>Broome,</hi> If the <hi>Leſſor</hi> ſhall not be charg'd upon his <hi>Covenant</hi> for the tortious Entry of his Aſſignee by this expreſs <hi>Covenant,</hi> then is the <hi>Covenant</hi> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for by a <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law upon the <hi>Leaſe</hi> it ſelf, he was to be charg'd for a legal Entry made by his Aſſignee, if this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> had not been at all.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, It is not neceſſary the <hi>Leſſor</hi> and <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what are <hi>Covenants</hi> in Law, and therefore they might impertinently make an expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> which they underſtood, which was already ſupplyed by an implyed <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they underſtood not.</p>
                  <p>As where a Feoffment is made by <hi>Dedi &amp; conceſſi,</hi> which is a <hi>warranty</hi> in Law, it is not rare to have an expreſs <hi>warranty</hi> of the ſame extent with the <hi>warranty</hi> in Law.</p>
                  <p>But there is a more cloſe and ſolid reaſon why they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>Covenant;</hi> for if they had not been expreſs'd, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> it ſelf had been a <hi>Covenant in Law</hi> againſt the legal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, both of them, and all men elſe. But by expreſſing a <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt them, the general <hi>Covenant</hi> againſt all men, is thereby reſtrain'd, and not inlarg'd againſt them; for now the <hi>Leſſor</hi> hath covenanted for enjoyment againſt the legal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of himſelf, his Executors, Adminiſtrators, and Aſſigns, and of no other.</p>
                  <p>This was clearly reſolv'd in <hi>Nokes</hi> his Caſe, where a man by his Deed granted and demis'd certain Lands for years, which Demiſe imported in it ſelf a <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law, and he further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly <hi>Covenanted</hi> for Enjoyment againſt himſelf, and all others, claiming from or under him, which expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> was nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than his <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law and gave Bond for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Covenants.</hi> Two points were reſolv'd:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Bond extended to the <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That by the expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>Law</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, by <hi>Popham's</hi> Opinion, and all the <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was agreed that the ſame had been reſolv'd before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14 <hi>El.</hi> in the Caſe of one <hi>Hamond.</hi> And Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> in the cloſe of the Caſe, ſaith, Much inconvenience would elſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen againſt the intention of parties. The expreſs <hi>Covenants</hi> in Deeds being different from the <hi>Covenants</hi> in <hi>Law</hi> uſually.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:99478:72"/>4. It is there agreed, That it is not ſo in real <hi>Warranties</hi> as in <hi>Covenants,</hi> but it is at choice to take the <hi>Warranty</hi> in law, or the expreſs <hi>Warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> is upon the Caſe in 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">46 E. 3. f. 4.</note> where the <hi>Leſſor</hi> outed his <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years, and infeoffed another of the Land, who held him out. It is agreed, That the <hi>Leſſee</hi> may have a <hi>quare ejecit infra terminum</hi> againſt the Feoffee, yet his Action was good againſt his <hi>Leſſor:</hi> But this Caſe makes nothing to the preſent Caſe.</p>
                  <p>For at the <hi>Common Law</hi> the <hi>Leſſee</hi> had no <hi>Action</hi> but of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> againſt his <hi>Leſſor,</hi> or an <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> at his choice.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Quare Ejecit infra terminum</hi> is given by the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. for recovery of his term againſt the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee; for an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> lies not againſt him becauſe he came to the Land by Title of <hi>Feoffment,</hi> and not by <hi>tort:</hi> And this new Remedy by <hi>Statute</hi> takes not away the ancient at <hi>Common Law,</hi> but the <hi>Common Law</hi> gives not two Satisfactions for the ſame Injury, as it would if the <hi>Covenantor</hi> and the <hi>Treſpaſſor</hi> were both charg'd to anſwer the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Book</hi> reſolves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Book</hi> of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 15. may be <hi>objected,</hi> A man infeoffed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and entred into Bond to warrant and defend the Land for <hi>twelve years:</hi> Two Iudges, the <hi>Court</hi> riſing, ſeemed to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word <hi>defend</hi> might not extend to <hi>defend</hi> from <hi>Entries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The difference ſome take of a <hi>Covenant</hi> to enjoy againſt one or more particular men, and to enjoy againſt all men; as if in the firſt Caſe the <hi>Covenantor</hi> were to be charg'd for the tortious Entries of particular men, but not where the <hi>Covenant</hi> is againſt all men, I underſtand not. As if all particular men, could they be enumerated, were not the ſame with all men; and as if ſome particular men were not a part of all particular men; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Law is the ſame for one as for all; the party hath his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the wrong doer, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> meaning no more whether againſt one or all, than that the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhould have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defeaſible Title in Law, and being but in nature of a <hi>Warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Caſe which gave colour to this Opinion, That if a man covenants for enjoyment againſt a particular perſon or perſons, that he covenants as well againſt their tortious Entries as legal.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe of <hi>Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> againſt <hi>Leonard Mapes</hi> 32 <hi>El.</hi> remembred in <hi>Tiſdels</hi> Caſe in the L. <hi>Hob. and reported by Crook.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hob. f. 35. Cro. 32 El. f. 212. pl. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mapes</hi> made a <hi>Leaſe</hi> of the <hi>Parſonage</hi> of <hi>Brankiſter</hi> to <hi>Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> for a year, and covenanted to ſave them harmleſs for that years profits, againſt one <hi>Blunt</hi> then <hi>Parſon</hi> of <hi>Brankiſter;</hi> who entred upon them, and took the <hi>Tithes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99478:73"/>
                  <p>In an <hi>Action of Covenant</hi> brought againſt <hi>Mapes</hi> by <hi>Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Foſter,</hi> though they did not ſet forth any good Title in Mr. <hi>Blunt</hi> for that years profits, it was judg'd for the <hi>Plaintiffs,</hi> becauſe, ſaith the Lord <hi>Hobert,</hi> the Covenant was to ſave them harmleſs for that years profits, againſt ſuch a man <hi>particularly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which imported they ſhould not be damnified in that years profits by <hi>Blunt,</hi> which was more than to warrant the Title, for <hi>Blunt</hi> might go beyond the Seas, dye inſolvent, and ſo prevent them of their Remedy for the profits.</p>
                  <p>So in <hi>Crook</hi> it is ſaid, That the <hi>Covenant</hi> being againſt a particular man, it extends to his tortious Entries <hi>arguendo,</hi> but there it appearing that <hi>Blunt</hi> was Parſon of the <hi>Rectory,</hi> the Court was of Opinion that his Entry was legal and good, and therefore the <hi>Covenantor,</hi> in that Caſe, was charg'd for a legal Entry, and not a wrongful. So is the Book expreſs in the end of the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>If a man upon ſale of Land refuſes to give a general War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty againſt all men, but narrows his Warranty, and gives only againſt him and his Heirs, this alters not the nature of the Warranty (as to make him any way anſwer for tortious Entries, or to ſubject him to any thing more than his Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt all men ſubjected him: So in a <hi>Covenant</hi> upon a Leaſe for Enjoyment againſt him and his Aſſigns, which (is in the nature of a Warranty for a Chattel) he ſhall not otherwiſe be charg'd by his <hi>Covenant,</hi> than if he had covenanted, that is, warranted, againſt all men.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Wringlington</hi> within one month after admiſſion inſtitution, and induction of <hi>Higden,</hi> the Incumbent of <hi>Wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> to the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> preſents <hi>Hugh Ivy,</hi> the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs</hi> Leſſor to <hi>Wringlington,</hi> who is admitted, inſtituted, and inducted thereto the ſame day, and after, as by the <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> enters and makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> to the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> who is Ejected by the <hi>Defendant Higden.</hi>

               <p>It hath been reſolv'd in <hi>Holland's</hi> Caſe, and likewiſe in <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Caſe, in the <hi>Fourth Report,</hi> and often before, ſince the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran, Anno Dom.</hi> 1215.<note place="margin">Under Pope Innocent 3.

               <p>But if the <hi>Patron</hi> will not preſent, then if under the value, no lapſe ſhall incurr until <hi>deprivation</hi> of the firſt <hi>Benefice,</hi> and notice; but if of the value of <hi>Eight pounds,</hi> or above, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> at his peril, muſt preſent within <hi>Six months,</hi> by 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second Queſtion,</hi> Whether the <hi>Defendants,</hi> not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> within <hi>two months</hi> after his induction there, have excluded him not only from being <hi>Incumbent</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Wringlington?</hi> The Anſwer is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, His not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> according to the <hi>Statute</hi> of 13. is neither any cauſe of, nor doth contribute to his not being ſtill <hi>Incumbent</hi> of <hi>Wringlington;</hi> though, as his Caſe is, he hath no right to the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Wringlington,</hi> ſince the admiſſion, inſtitution, and induction of <hi>Hugh Ivy,</hi> the <hi>Plaintiffs</hi> Leſſor, into it, as hath already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> although it doth not appear that the <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Elme</hi> hath preſented, as he might have done, or perhaps hath, any other <hi>Clerk;</hi> or that any other is admitted and inſtituted into that <hi>Church,</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Higden</hi> can be no <hi>Incumbent</hi> there, nor can ſue for Tithes, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Duty; becauſe, by not reading the <hi>Articles,</hi> he ſtands depriv'd <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>

               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:99478:75"/>
               <p> For clearing this, certain Clauſes of the <hi>Act</hi> of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are to be open'd.</p>
               <p>The firſt is;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every perſon, after the end of this Seſſion of Parliament, to be admitted to a Benefice with Cure, except that within two Months after his induction, he publickly read the ſaid Articles in the ſame Church whereof he ſhall have Cure, in the time of Common-prayer there, with Declaration of his unfeigned aſſent thereto, &amp;c. ſhall be upon every ſuch Default, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> immediately depriv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There follows, relative to this Clauſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Provided always, That no Title to conferr or preſent by lapſe, ſhall accrue upon any deprivation, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but after ſix Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notice of ſuch deprivation given by the Ordinary to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Clauſes immediately upon not reading the <hi>Articles,</hi> according to the <hi>Statute,</hi> the <hi>Incumbent</hi> is depriv'd <hi>ipſo facto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Patron</hi> may preſently, upon ſuch <hi>Deprivation,</hi> preſent if he will, and his Clerk ought to be admitted and inſtituted, but if he do not, no <hi>lapſe</hi> incurrs until after <hi>ſix months</hi> after notice of the <hi>Deprivation</hi> given to the <hi>Patron</hi> by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> who is to ſupply the Cure until the <hi>Patron</hi> preſent.</p>
               <p>Another Clauſe of the <hi>Statute</hi> is, <hi>No perſon ſhall hereafter be admitted to any Benefice with Cure, except he then be of the Age of Three and twenty years at the leaſt, and a Deacon, and ſhall firſt have ſubſcribed the ſaid Articles in the preſence of the Ordinary, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And relative to this Clauſe there is a third, <hi>That all Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Benefices, Inſtitutions, and Inductions of any perſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any proviſion of this Act, ſhall be utterly void in Law, as if they never were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though the Church of <hi>Wringlington</hi> became void im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, of what value ſoever it were, by admiſſion and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Defendant</hi> into the Church of <hi>Elme,</hi> by the ancient <hi>Canon Law</hi> receiv'd in this Kingdom, <hi>which is the Law of the Kingdom in ſuch Caſes,</hi> if the <hi>Patron</hi> pleas'd to preſent.</p>
               <p>And for that the <hi>Patron</hi> accordingly did within a month after the <hi>Defendants</hi> Admiſſion and Inſtitution into the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> preſent his Clerk, <hi>Hugh Ivy,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> who was thereto Admitted, Inſtituted, and Inducted within that time, which was a month before the <hi>Defendant</hi> was depriv'd for not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> in the Church of <hi>Elme.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:99478:75"/>
               <p>Whereby any Intereſt the <hi>Defendant</hi> had to <hi>Wringlington,</hi> was wholly avoided, as the Caſe is.</p>
               <p>Yet if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Wringlington</hi> had been under value, and the <hi>Patron</hi> had not preſented to it his Clerk before <hi>Higden's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> he might not have ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Parſon</hi> of <hi>Wringlington,</hi> as if never Admitted, Inſtituted, or Inducted to the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Elme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if he had not ſubſcribed the <hi>Articles</hi> before the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> upon his Admiſſion and Inſtitution to the <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> he had never been <hi>Incumbent</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> and conſequently never accepted a ſecond <hi>Benefice</hi> to diſable him of holding the firſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is reſolv'd in the laſt Caſe of the Lord <hi>Dyer, 23</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> where a man having a Living with Cure under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, accepted another under value alſo, having no Qualification or Diſpenſation, and was Admitted, Inſtituted, and Inducted into the <hi>Second,</hi> but never ſubſcribed the <hi>Articles</hi> before the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> as the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>13.</hi> requires. Vpon queſtion, whether the <hi>firſt</hi> Living, <hi>vacavit per mortem,</hi> of him, or not? the <hi>Court</hi> reſolv'd, That the <hi>firſt</hi> Living became <hi>vacant</hi> by his death, and not by accepting the <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe he was never <hi>Incumbent</hi> of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> for not ſubſcribing the <hi>Articles</hi> before the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> whereby his Admiſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction into the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Living became void, as if they had never been.</p>
               <p>This Caſe was urg'd at the Barr for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> as if his not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> within <hi>two months</hi> after his Induction into <hi>Elme,</hi> had ſtill (as in the Lord <hi>Dyers Caſe</hi>) left him <hi>Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent</hi> of the <hi>firſt Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that was miſtaken; for not ſubſcribing the <hi>Articles,</hi> made that he never was <hi>Incumbent</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Living,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently then there was no cauſe to loſe the <hi>firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Defendant</hi> having ſubſcribed the <hi>Articles</hi> upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Inſtitution, was perfect <hi>Incumbent, pro tempore,</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Living,</hi> and thereby loſt the <hi>firſt,</hi> and afterwards loſt the <hi>ſecond,</hi> for not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> within <hi>two months</hi> after his Induction, ſo as he was compleat <hi>Incumbent</hi> by Admiſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction of the <hi>ſecond Living,</hi> full <hi>two months</hi> before he loſt it.</p>
               <p>It was upon this Clauſe of the <hi>Statute</hi> ſmartly urg'd by my Brother <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> That if the <hi>Statute</hi> makes the <hi>Defendants</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction to the <hi>ſecond Living,</hi> void, as if they had never been; For what reaſon doth he not ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his firſt? The Anſwer is as before.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:99478:76"/>
                  <hi>1.</hi> That his not retaining the <hi>firſt,</hi> is no effect nor conſequent of his loſing the ſecond.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>firſt</hi> was loſt becauſe he accepted a <hi>ſecond,</hi> and the right <hi>Patron</hi> thereupon preſented to the <hi>firſt;</hi> ſo as he loſt the <hi>firſt,</hi> whilſt he was, and for being, lawful <hi>Incumbent</hi> of the <hi>ſecond:</hi> And therefore could be no effect nor conſequent at all proceeding from his loſs of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> by not reading the <hi>Articles</hi> after, more than if he had loſt the <hi>ſecond</hi> by <hi>Deprivation</hi> for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or other cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The Clauſe of <hi>13.</hi> is not, That all Admiſſions, Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Inductions to <hi>Benefices,</hi> where any perſon is depriv'd by virtue of that Act, ſhall be <hi>void as if they never were;</hi> for ſo ſhould the Clauſe have been to warrant the Objection made at the Barr.</p>
               <p>But the Clauſe is, <hi>That all Admiſſions, Inſtitutions, and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made contrary to any proviſion of the Act, ſhall be void, as if they never were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Higden's</hi> Admiſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Elme,</hi> was not contrary to any proviſion of the Act, but every way legal; but had he not ſubſcribed the <hi>Articles</hi> before the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> then his Admiſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction had been contrary to the proviſion of the Act, and ſo void, as if they never were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Juſtice delivered the Opinion of the Court, and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> is now the moſt uſual Remedy by which a man is reſtored again to his <hi>Liberty,</hi> if he have been againſt <hi>Law</hi> deprived of it.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:99478:77"/>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Writ</hi> commands the Day, and the cauſe of the Caption and Detaining of the Priſoner to be certified upon the Retorn, which if not done, the <hi>Court</hi> cannot poſſibly judge whether the cauſe of the <hi>Commitment</hi> and <hi>Detainer</hi> be according to Law, or againſt it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the cauſe of the Impriſonment ought, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn, to appear as <hi>ſpecifically</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> to the Iudges of the Retorn, as it did appear to the <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Perſon</hi> authorized to commit; elſe the Retorn is <hi>inſufficient,</hi> and the <hi>conſequence</hi> muſt be,</p>
               <p>That either the Priſoner, becauſe the cauſe retorn'd of his Impriſonment is <hi>too general,</hi> muſt be <hi>diſcharg'd;</hi> when as if the cauſe had been more particularly retorn'd, he ought to have been <hi>remanded;</hi> or elſe he muſt be <hi>remanded,</hi> when if the cauſe had been particularly retorn'd, he ought to have been diſcharg'd: Both which are <hi>Inconveniences</hi> not agreeing with the dignity of the Law. (There is a ſpecious Exception to this Rule, but doth not materially vary it, as ſhall appear.)</p>
               <p>In the preſent Caſe it is retorn'd, That the Priſoner, being a <hi>Jury-man,</hi> among others charg'd at the <hi>Seſſions Court</hi> of the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> to try the Iſſue between the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Penn,</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi> upon an <hi>Indictment,</hi> for aſſembling unlawfully and tumultuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did <hi>contra plenam &amp; manifeſtam evidentiam,</hi> openly given in <hi>Court,</hi> acquit the Priſoners indicted, in contempt of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Court</hi> hath no knowledge by this retorn, whether the Evidence given were full and manifeſt, or doubtful, lame, and dark, or indeed Evidence at all material to the Iſſue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not retorn'd what Evidence in particular, and as it was deliver'd, was given. For it is not poſſible to judge of that rightly, which is not expos'd to a mans Iudgment. But here the Evidence given to the Iury is not expoſed at all to this <hi>Court,</hi> but the Iudgment of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Seſſions upon that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is only expos'd to us;</hi> who tell us it was full and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. But our Iudgment ought to be grounded upon our own inferences and underſtandings, and not upon theirs.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid by a <hi>Learned Judge, If the Jury might be fined for finding againſt manifeſt Evidence, the retorn was good, though it did not expreſs what the Evidence particularly was, whereby the Court might Judge of it, becauſe retorning all the Evidence would be too long. A ſtrange Reaſon:</hi> For if the Law allow me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for wrong Impriſonment, and that muſt be by judging whether the cauſe of it were good, or not, to ſay the cauſe is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99478:78"/> too long to be made known, is to ſay the Law gives a remedy which it will not let me have, or I muſt be wrongfully impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd ſtill, becauſe it is too long to know that I ought to be freed? What is neceſſary to an end, the Law allows is never too long. <hi>Non ſunt longa quibus nihil eſt quod demere poſſis,</hi> is as true as any <hi>Axiom in Euclid.</hi> Beſides, one manifeſt Evidence retorn'd had ſuffic'd, without retorning all the Evidence. <hi>But the other Judges were not of his mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the retorn had been, That the <hi>Jurors</hi> were committed by an <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Court of Seſſions,</hi> becauſe they did, <hi>minus juſte,</hi> acquit the perſons indicted.</p>
               <p>Or becauſe they did, <hi>contra legem,</hi> acquit the perſons indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Or becauſe they did, <hi>contra Sacramentum ſuum,</hi> acquit them.</p>
               <p>The Iudges cannot upon the preſent more judge of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal cauſe of their <hi>commitment,</hi> than they could if any of theſe cauſes, as general as they are, had been retorn'd for the cauſe of their <hi>commitment.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Argument</hi> may be exactly made to juſtifie any of theſe retorns, had they been made as to juſtifie the preſent retorn, they being equally as legal, equally as certain, and equally as far from poſſeſſing the Court with the truth of the cauſe: and in what condition ſhould all men be for the juſt <hi>Liberty</hi> of their perſons, if ſuch cauſes ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſufficient cauſes to remand perſons to priſon.</p>
               <p>To thoſe Objections made by the Priſoners Council againſt the Retorn, as too general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath been ſaid, That <hi>Inſtitutum eſt quod non inquiratur de diſcretione Judicis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>As for any ſuch Inſtitution pretended, I know no ſuch, nor believe any ſuch, as it was applyed to the preſent cauſe; but taking it in another, and in the true ſenſe, I admit it for truth: that is, when the <hi>King</hi> hath conſtituted any man a Iudge under him, his ability, parts, fitneſs for his place, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on, cenſured, defamed, or vilified by any other perſon, being allowed and ſtampt with the <hi>Kings</hi> Approbation, to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99478:78"/> whom only it belongs to judge of the fitneſs of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>And ſuch <hi>ſcandalous Aſſertions</hi> or <hi>Inquiries</hi> upon the <hi>Judges</hi> of both <hi>Benches,</hi> is forbidden by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5.

               <p>And in that ſenſe the ſaying concerns not the preſent Caſe.</p>
               <p>But if any man thinks that a perſon concern'd in <hi>Intereſt,</hi> by the Iudgment, Action, or Authority exercis'd upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or fortunes by a <hi>Judge,</hi> muſt ſubmit in all, or any of theſe, to the <hi>implyed diſcretion</hi> and <hi>unerringneſs</hi> of his <hi>Judge,</hi> without ſeeking ſuch redreſs as the Law allows him, it is a perſwaſion againſt <hi>common Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>received Law,</hi> and <hi>uſage both of this Kingdome, and almoſt all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a <hi>Court,</hi> Inferiour or Superiour, hath given a falſe or erroneous Iudgment, is any thing more frequent than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſuch Iudgments by <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Falſe Judgment,</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Appeals,</hi> according to the courſe of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>If they have given corrupt and diſhoneſt Iudgments, they have in all Ages been complained of to the King in the <hi>Starr-Chamber,</hi> or to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andrew Horne,</hi> in his <hi>Mirror of Juſtices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hornes Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, f. 296.</note> mentions many <hi>Judges</hi> puniſht by <hi>King Alfred</hi> before the <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> for corrupt Iudgments, and their particular Names and Offences, which could not be had but from the Records of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Stories</hi> mention many puniſht in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Firſt, our Parliament Rolls of Edward the Third's time, of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the Second's Time,</hi> for the pernicious Reſolutions given at <hi>Nottingham Caſtle,</hi> afford Examples of this kind: In latter times, <hi>the Parliament Journals of</hi> 18 <hi>and</hi> 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> the Iudgment of the <hi>Ship-mony</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> queſtion'd, and the particular <hi>Judges</hi> impeacht.

               <p>In caſes of retorns too general upon <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> of many I could urge, I will inſtance in two only.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Aſtwick</hi> brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 El. Moore, f. 837.</note> was retorn'd to be committed, <hi>per Mandatum Nicholai Bacon Militis, domini Cuſtodis magni Sigilli Angliae virtute cujuſdam Contemptus in Curia Cancellar. facti,</hi> and was preſently bail'd.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99478:79"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">13 Jac. Moore f. 839.</note>One <hi>Apſley,</hi> Priſoner in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> upon a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> was retorn'd to be committed, <hi>per conſiderationem Curiae Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellar. pro contemptu eidem Curiae illato,</hi> and upon this retorn ſet at liberty.</p>
               <p>In both theſe Caſes, no inquiry was made, or conſideration had, whether the Contempts were to the <hi>Law Court,</hi> or <hi>equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court of Chancery,</hi> either was alike to the <hi>Judges,</hi> leſt any man ſhould think a difference might ariſe thence.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of diſcharging the Priſoners upon thoſe retorns, was the generality of them being for <hi>Contempts</hi> to the <hi>Court,</hi> but no particular of the Contempt expreſt, whereby the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> could judge, whether it were a cauſe for commitment or not.</p>
               <p>And was it not as ſuppoſeable, and as much to be credited, That the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and <hi>Court of Chancery,</hi> did well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what was a Contempt deſerving commitment, as it is now to be credited, that the <hi>Court of Seſſions</hi> did underſtand perfectly what was full and manifeſt Evidence againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indicted at the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> and therefore it needed not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us upon the retorn?</p>
               <p>Hence it is apparent, That the <hi>Commitment</hi> and <hi>Retorn</hi> purſuing it, being in it ſelf too general and uncertain, we ought not implicitly to think the Commitment was <hi>re vera,</hi> for cauſe particular and ſufficient enough, becauſe it was the <hi>Act of the Court of Seſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the other part, That the <hi>Court of Seſſions</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is not to be reſembled to other inferiour <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> becauſe all the <hi>Judges</hi> are commiſſion'd here (which is true) but few are there, at the ſame time, and as I have heard, when this Tryal was, none of them were preſent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſons of great quality are in the Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> through the <hi>Shires</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and always ſome of the <hi>Judges;</hi> nor doth one Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> differ in its Eſſence, Nature, and Power from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they be general <hi>Commiſſions;</hi> but all differ in the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> which makes no alteration in their actings in the eye of <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another fault in the retorn is, That the <hi>Jurors</hi> are not ſaid to have acquitted the perſons indicted, againſt full and manifeſt Evidence <hi>corruptly, and knowing the ſaid Evidence to be full and manifeſt againſt the perſons indicted,</hi> for how manifeſt ſoever the Evidence was, if it were not manifeſt to them, and that they believ'd it ſuch, it was not a <hi>finable fault,</hi> nor deſerving
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99478:79"/> impriſonment, upon which difference the Law of puniſhing <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> for falſe Verdicts principally depends.</p>

               <p>After theſe Authorities,</p>
               <p>I would know whether any thing be more common, than for two men Students, Barriſters, or Iudges, to deduce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and oppoſite Concluſions out of the ſame Caſe in Law? And is there any difference that two men ſhould inferr diſtinct concluſions from the ſame Teſtimony? Is any thing more known than that the ſame Author, and place in that Author, is forcibly urg'd to maintain contrary concluſions, and the deciſion hard, which is in the right? Is any thing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the controverſies of <hi>Religion,</hi> than to preſs the ſame Text for oppoſite Tenents? How then comes it to paſs that two perſons may not apprehend with reaſon and honeſty, what a witneſs, or many, ſay, to prove in the underſtanding of one plainly one thing, but in the apprehenſion of the other, clearly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99478:80"/> the contrary thing? Muſt therefore one of theſe merit Fine and Impriſonment, becauſe he doth that which he cannot otherwiſe do, preſerving his Oath and Integrity? And this often is the Caſe of the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of this mind were Ten Judges of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven, the Chief Baron Turnor gave no Opinion, becauſe not at the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>I conclude therefore, That this Retorn, charging the Priſoners to have acquitted <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi> againſt full and manifeſt Evidence firſt and next, without ſaying that they did <hi>know and believe that Evidence to be full and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt</hi> againſt the indicted perſons, is no cauſe of Fine or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
               <p>And by the way I muſt here note, That the <hi>Verdict</hi> of a <hi>Jury,</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of a <hi>Witneſs</hi> are very different things, in the truth and falſhood of them: A <hi>Witneſs</hi> ſwears but to what he hath heard or ſeen, generally or more largely, to what hath fallen under his ſenſes.

               <p>There is one <hi>Objection</hi> which hath been made by none, as I remember, to juſtifie this <hi>general Retorn,</hi> I would give An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to.</p>
               <p>A man committed for <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> and bringing a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> hath retorn'd upon it, That he was committed for <hi>High Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony;</hi> and this is a ſufficient Retorn to remand him, though in truth this is a general Retorn: For if the ſpecifical Fact for which the party was committed, were expreſſed in the <hi>Warrant,</hi> it might then perhaps appear to be no <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> but a <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> as in the Caſe of the <hi>Earl of Northumberland,</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. queſtion'd for <hi>Treaſon</hi> in raiſing power.

               </p>
               <p>Why then by like Reaſon may not this Retorn be ſufficient, though the Fact for which the Priſoners ſtood committed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſs'd, might be no cauſe of <hi>Commitment?</hi>

                  </label> The Caſes are not alike; for upon a general Commitment for <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> the Priſoner (the cauſe appearing) may preſs for his Tryal, which ought not to be denied or delayed, and upon his Indictment and Tryal, the particular cauſe of his Impriſonment muſt appear, which proving no <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,</hi> the Priſoner ſhall have the benefit of it. But in this Caſe, though the Evidence given were no full nor manifeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence againſt the perſons indicted, but ſuch as the <hi>Jury</hi> upon it ought to have acquitted thoſe indicted, the Priſoner ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any benefit of it, but muſt continue in Priſon, when remanded, until he hath paid that Fine unjuſtly impos'd on him, which was the whole end of his Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>We come now to the next part of the Retorn, <hi>viz. That the Jury acquitted thoſe indicted againſt the direction of the Court in matter of Law, openly given and declared to them in Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The words, <hi>That the Jury did acquit, againſt the direction of the Court, in matter of Law,</hi> literally taken, and <hi>de plano,</hi> are inſignificant, and not intelligible; for no Iſſue can be joyn'd of matter in Law, no <hi>Jury</hi> can be charg'd with the tryal of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law barely, no Evidence ever was, or can be given to a <hi>Jury</hi> of what is Law, or not; nor no ſuch Oath can be given to, or taken by, a <hi>Jury,</hi> to try matter in Law; nor no <hi>Attaint</hi> can lye for ſuch a falſe Oath.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt take off this <hi>vail</hi> and <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>words,</hi> which make a ſhew of being ſomething, and in truth are nothing.</p>
               <p>If the meaning of theſe words, <hi>finding againſt the direction of the Court in matter of Law,</hi> be, That if the <hi>Judge</hi> having heard the Evidence given in Court (for he knows no other) ſhall tell the <hi>Jury,</hi> upon this Evidence, the Law is for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> or for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and you are under the pain of Fine and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment to find accordingly, then the <hi>Jury</hi> ought of duty ſo to do; Every man ſees that the <hi>Jury</hi> is but a troubleſome delay, great charge, and of no uſe in determining right and wrong, and therefore the Tryals by them may be better aboliſh'd than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; which were a ſtrange new-found concluſion, after a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſo celebrated for many hundreds of years.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Judge,</hi> from the Evidence, ſhall by his own Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt reſolve upon any Tryal what the Fact is, and ſo knowing the Fact, ſhall then reſolve what the Law is, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jury</hi> penally to find accordingly, what either neceſſary or convenient uſe can be fancied of <hi>Juries,</hi> or to continue Tryals by them at all?</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99478:81"/>
               <p>But if the Iury be not oblig'd in all Tryals to follow ſuch Directions, if given, but only in ſome ſort of Tryals (As for inſtance, in Tryals for Criminal matters upon Indictments or Appeals) why then the conſequence will be, though not in all, yet in Criminal Tryals, the Iury (as of no material uſe) ought to be either omitted or aboliſhed, which were the greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the people, than to aboliſh them in Civil Tryals.</p>
               <p>And how the Iury ſhould, in any other manner, according to the courſe of Tryals us'd, find againſt the direction of the Court in matter of Law, is really not conceptible.</p>
               <p>True it is, if it fall out upon ſome ſpecial Tryal, that the Iury being ready to give their Verdict, and before it is given, the Iudge ſhall ask, whether they find ſuch a particular thing propounded by him? or whether they find the matter of Fact to be as ſuch a Witneſs, or Witneſſes have depos'd? and the Iury anſwer, they find the matter of Fact to be ſo; if then the Iudge ſhall declare, The matter of Fact being by you ſo found to be, the Law is for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and you are to find according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him.</p>
               <p>If notwithſtanding they find for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> this may be thought a <hi>finding in matter of Law againſt the direction of the Court;</hi> for in that caſe the Iury firſt declare the Fact, as it is found by themſelves, to which Fact the Iudge declares how the Law is conſequent.</p>
               <p>And this is ordinary, when the Iury find unexpectedly for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> the Iudge will ask, How do you find ſuch a Fact in particular? and upon their anſwer he will ſay, then it is for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> though they found for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> or <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trario,</hi> and thereupon they rectifie their Verdict.</p>
               <p>And in theſe Caſes the Iury, and not the Iudge, reſolve and find what the Fact is.</p>
               <p>Therefore alwaies in diſcreet and lawful aſſiſtance of the Iury, the Iudge his direction is <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> and upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and not <hi>poſitive,</hi> and upon <hi>coercion. viz. If you find the Fact thus</hi> (leaving it to them what to find) <hi>then you are to find for the Plaintiff; but if you find the Fact thus, then it is for the Defendant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the Caſe propounded by me, where it is poſſible in that ſpecial manner, the Iury may find againſt the Direction of the Court in matter of Law, it will not follow they are therefore <hi>finable; for if an Attaint will lye upon the Verdict ſo given by them, they ought not to be fined and impriſoned by the Judge for that Verdict;</hi> for all the Iudges have agreed upon a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99478:81"/> full conference at <hi>Serjeants Inn,</hi> in this caſe. And it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo agreed by the then <hi>Judges</hi> in a Caſe where <hi>Juſtice Hide</hi> had fined a <hi>Jury</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for finding againſt their Evidence in a <hi>Civil Cauſe. That a Jury is not finable for going againſt their Evidence, where an Attaint lies;</hi> for if an Attaint be brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Verdict, it may be affirmed and found upon the <hi>Attaint</hi> a true Verdict, and the ſame Verdict cannot be a falſe Verdict, and therefore the <hi>Jury</hi> fined for it as ſuch by the <hi>Judge,</hi> and yet no falſe Verdict, becauſe affirmed upon the <hi>Attaint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Reaſon that the <hi>Jury</hi> may not be fined in ſuch caſe, is, becauſe until a <hi>Jury</hi> have conſummated their Verdict, which is not done until they find for the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant,</hi> and that alſo be <hi>entred of Record;</hi> they have time ſtill of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and whatſoever they have anſwered the <hi>Judge</hi> upon an <hi>interlocutory Queſtion</hi> or <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> they may lawfully vary from it if they find cauſe, and are not thereby concluded.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows upon this laſt Reaſon, <hi>That upon Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als wherein no Attaint lies, as well as upon ſuch where it doth, no caſe can be invented; wherein it can be maintained that a Jury can find, in matter of Law, nakedly againſt the direction of the Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Judges</hi> were (as before) all of Opinion, That the Retorn in this latter part of it, is alſo inſufficient, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo wholly inſufficient.</p>
               <p>But that this Queſtion may not hereafter revive if poſſible, It is evident by ſeveral <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of all the <hi>Judges,</hi> That where an <hi>Attaint</hi> lies, the <hi>Judge</hi> cannot fine the <hi>Jury</hi> for going againſt their Evidence or Direction of the Court, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſdemeanour.</p>
               <p>For in ſuch caſe, finding againſt, or following the direction of the Court barely, will not barr an <hi>Attaint,</hi> but in ſome caſe the <hi>Judge</hi> being demanded by, and declaring to, the <hi>Jury,</hi> what is the Law, though he declares it <hi>erroneouſly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ingerſalls C. Cr. 35 El. f. 309. n. 18.</note> and they find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, this may excuſe the <hi>Jury</hi> from the Forfeitures; for though their Verdict be <hi>falſe,</hi> yet it is not <hi>corrupt,</hi> but the Iudgment is to be revers'd however upon the <hi>Attaint;</hi> for a man loſeth not his right by the <hi>Judges</hi> miſtake in the Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore if an <hi>Attaint</hi> lies for a <hi>falſe Verdict</hi> upon <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> not Capital (as this is) either by the <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Statute Law,</hi> by thoſe Reſolutions, the Court would not fine the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in this caſe, for going againſt Evidence, becauſe an <hi>Attaint</hi> lay.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:99478:82"/>
               <p>But admitting an <hi>Attaint</hi> did not lye (as I think the Law clear it did not) for there is no Caſe in all the Law of ſuch an <hi>Attaint,</hi> nor Opinion, but that of <hi>Thirnings</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Attaint</hi> 60. <hi>&amp;</hi> 64. for which there is no warrant in Law, though there be other ſpecious Authority againſt it, toucht by none that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued this Caſe.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then will be, Whether before the ſeveral <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> which granted <hi>Attaints,</hi> and are enumerated in their order in the <hi>Regiſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reg. f. 122. a.</note> the <hi>Judge</hi> by the Common Law, in all Caſes, might have fined the <hi>Jury,</hi> finding againſt their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and direction of the Court, where no <hi>Attaint</hi> did lye, or could ſo do, yet if the <hi>Statutes</hi> which gave the <hi>Attaints</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd.</p>
               <p>If he could not in Civil Cauſes before <hi>Attaints</hi> granted in them, he could not in Criminal Cauſes, upon Indictment (wherein I have admitted <hi>Attaint</hi> lies not) for the fault in both was the ſame, <hi>viz. finding againſt Evidence and Direction of the Court,</hi> and by the Common Law; the Reaſon being the ſame in both, the Law is the ſame.</p>
               <p>That the Court could not Fine a <hi>Jury</hi> at the Common Law, where <hi>Attaint</hi> did not lye (for where it did, is agreed he could not) I think to be the cleareſt poſition that ever I conſider'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Authority or Reaſon of Law.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Attaints</hi> were granted by <hi>Statutes</hi> generally; As by <hi>Weſtminſter the Firſt, c.</hi> 38. <hi>in Pleas Real,</hi> and by 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. in <hi>Pleas Perſonal,</hi> and where they did lye at Common Law (which was only in <hi>Writs of Aſſiſe</hi>) The Examples are frequent in our Books of puniſhing <hi>Jurors</hi> by <hi>Attaint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no Caſe can be offer'd, either before <hi>Attaints</hi> granted in general, or after, That ever a <hi>Jury</hi> was puniſh't by <hi>Fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Juries</hi> might be fined in ſuch Caſe before <hi>Attaints</hi> granted, why not ſince? for no <hi>Statute</hi> hath taken that power from the <hi>Judge.</hi> But ſince <hi>Attaints</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the <hi>Judges</hi> reſolved they cannot Fine where the <hi>Attaint</hi> lies, therefore they could not Fine before. Sure this latter Age did not firſt diſcover that the Verdicts of <hi>Juries</hi> were many times not according to the <hi>Judges</hi> opinion and liking.</p>
               <p>But the Reaſons are, I conceive, moſt clear, That the <hi>Judge</hi> could not, nor can Fine and Impriſon the <hi>Jury</hi> in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:99478:82"/>
               <p>Without a Fact agreed, it is as impoſſible for a <hi>Judge;</hi> or any other, to know the Law relating to that Fact, or direct concerning it, as to know an Accident that hath no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows; That the <hi>Judge</hi> can never direct what the Law is in any matter controverted, without firſt knowing the Fact; and then it follows, That without his previous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Fact, the <hi>Jury</hi> cannot go againſt his Direction in Law, for he could not direct.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Judge, quà Judge,</hi> cannot know the Fact poſſibly, but from the Evidence which the <hi>Jury</hi> have, but (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) he can never know what Evidence the <hi>Jury</hi> have, and conſequently he cannot know the matter of Fact, nor puniſh the <hi>Jury</hi> for going againſt their Evidence, when he cannot know what their Evidence is.</p>
               <p>It is true, if the <hi>Jury</hi> were to have no other Evidence for the Fact, but what is depos'd in Court, the <hi>Judge</hi> might know their Evidence, and the Fact from it, equally as they, and ſo direct what the Law were in the Caſe, though even then the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> might honeſtly differ in the reſult from the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as two <hi>Judges</hi> may, which often happens.</p>
               <p>But the Evidence which the <hi>Jury</hi> have of the Fact is much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Being return'd of the <hi>Vicinage,</hi> whence the cauſe of Action ariſeth, the Law ſuppoſeth them thence to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge to try the matter in Iſſue (and ſo they muſt) though no Evidence were given on either ſide in Court, but to this Evidence the <hi>Judge</hi> is a ſtranger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They may have Evidence from their own perſonal knowledge, by which they may be aſſur'd, and ſometimes are, that what is depos'd in Court, is abſolutely falſe; but to this the <hi>Judge</hi> is a ſtranger, and he knows no more of the Fact than he hath learn'd in Court, and perhaps by falſe Depoſitions, and conſequently knows nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Jury</hi> may know the Witneſſes to be <hi>ſtigmatiz'd</hi> and <hi>infamous,</hi> which may be unknown to the parties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the Court.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In many Caſes the <hi>Jury</hi> are to have <hi>View neceſſarily,</hi> in many, by conſent, for their better information; to this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence likewiſe the <hi>Judge</hi> is a ſtranger.</p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Priviledges</hi> are not <hi>detrimental</hi> to any, becauſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath occaſion to ſue an Officer, or any other, having priority of Suit as before, is not reſtrained to ſue them in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> but is reſtrained from ſuing elſewhere. <hi>And this is the true Priviledge of the Court.</hi>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Another way of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> by reaſon of Suit depending in <hi>A Superiour Court,</hi> is, when a perſon impleading or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded, as in the <hi>Common Bench,</hi> is after arreſted in a Civil Action or Plaint in <hi>London,</hi> or elſewhere, and by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> is brought to the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and the Arreſt and Cauſe retorn'd; if it appear to the <hi>Court,</hi> That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in <hi>London</hi> was after the party ought to have had the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas;</hi> he ſhall have his <hi>Priviledg</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, and be diſcharg'd of his Arreſt, and the party left to

                     <hi>2.</hi> If the cauſe of the Impriſonment retorn'd, be a lawful cauſe, but which cannot be proſecuted in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, Treaſon,</hi> or ſome cauſe wherein the <hi>High Commiſſion, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,</hi> or <hi>other Court,</hi> had power to impriſon lawfully, then the party impriſon'd, which did implead, or was impleaded in the <hi>Common Bench</hi> before ſuch impriſonment, ſhall not be allow'd <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but ought to be remanded.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> The third way is, when a man is brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>Court,</hi> and upon retorn of it, it appears to the <hi>Court,</hi> That he was againſt <hi>Law impriſon'd and detain'd,</hi> though there be no cauſe of <hi>Priviledge</hi> for him in this <hi>Court,</hi> he ſhall never be by the Act of the <hi>Court</hi> remanded to his unlawful impriſonment, for then the <hi>Court</hi> ſhould do an act of Injuſtice in impriſoning him, <hi>de novo,</hi> againſt Law, whereas the great <hi>Charter</hi> is, <hi>Quod nullus liber homo impriſonetur niſi per legem terrae;</hi> This is the preſent caſe, and this was the caſe upon all the <hi>Preſidents</hi> produc'd and many more that might be produc'd, where upon <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> many have been <hi>diſcharg'd and bail'd,</hi> though there was no cauſe of <hi>Priviledge</hi> in the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>This appears plainly by many <hi>old Books,</hi> if the Reaſon of them be rightly taken, <hi>For inſufficient cauſes are as no cauſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn'd;</hi> and to ſend a man back to Priſon for no cauſe retorn'd, ſeems unworthy of a <hi>Court.</hi>

               <p>It is clear,<note place="margin">Dyer 31 H. 8. 43. b. n. 22.</note> That formerly in the times of <hi>Henry the Eighth, Queen Mary,</hi> and <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> it was ſuppos'd that ſome <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> were due by the <hi>Common Law</hi> (wherein the King had an Inheritance) for certain Merchandiſe to be tranſported out of the Realm; and that ſuch Cuſtomes were not originally due by any <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> ſo is the Book <hi>31 H. 8.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This was, in thoſe ſeveral Reigns, the Opinion of all the Iudges of the times; whence we may learn how fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible even the Opinion of all the <hi>Judges</hi> is, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſeſolved muſt be clear'd by Searchers not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and depends not upon Caſes vulgarily known by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Year Books.</hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99478:90"/> they were granted by the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter the Firſt,</hi> or by the ſame <hi>Parliament,</hi> and probably therefore it was by a <hi>Rider (as Proviſo's now uſually are) annex'd,</hi> by tacking to the Bill or Law of <hi>Weſtminſter the Firſt,</hi> and from it after caſually loſt.</p>
               <p>So as it is now clear, That <hi>Antiqua Cuſtuma,</hi> upon <hi>Woolls, Pells,</hi> and <hi>Leather</hi> was not by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> but by <hi>Act of Parliament 3 E. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any ſcruple remain'd of a power at <hi>Common Law</hi> to charge Merchandiſe in any other manner, the Act of the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of the King, which grants him <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> clears it from queſtion in theſe words, <hi>And becauſe no Rates can be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon Merchandiſe Imported or Exported by Subjects or Aliens, but by common conſent in Parliament, it Enacts that Rates upon Merchandiſe ſhall be according to the Book of Rates, eſtabliſht by the Act, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nor is it a true Inference, That if the <hi>Antiquae Cuſtumae</hi> were at <hi>Common Law</hi> (as every thing in one ſenſe is taken for <hi>Common Law,</hi> if it be Law, when it appears not to be by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi>) therefore it was by <hi>Arbitrary Impoſition</hi> of the King, for it might be by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> not extant, as this of <hi>3 E. 1.</hi> and in truth, moſt of the <hi>Common Law</hi> cannot be conceived to be Law otherwiſe than by <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Power equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> to them, whereof the <hi>Rolls</hi> are loſt; for alwaies there was a power and practiſe of making new Laws.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> At the <hi>Common Law, wreck'd Goods</hi> (as theſe are found to be) could not be chargeable with <hi>Cuſtome</hi> (if other Goods were) for at the <hi>Common Law</hi> all <hi>wreck</hi> was wholly the <hi>Kings,</hi> and he could not have a ſmall Duty of <hi>Cuſtome</hi> out of that which was all his own:<note place="margin">Weſt. 1. c. 4.

               <p>It remains clear then, That <hi>Wax</hi> is a <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> ſubject to pay the duty of <hi>Poundage</hi> by, and according to, the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of this <hi>King,</hi> and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then before us (being narrow'd) will be, Whether <hi>Wax,</hi> or any other Goods ſubject to the Duty of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage</hi> by the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Book of Rates,</hi> the <hi>Twelfth</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> ſhip'd in Forraign parts, as <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>England,</hi> but for other Forraign parts, proving to be <hi>wreck,</hi> and caſt by the Sea upon a <hi>Mannor,</hi> to which <hi>wreck</hi> belongs by <hi>Preſcription,</hi> ought to anſwer the Duty of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage,</hi> as if <hi>Imported,</hi> as <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> in Ships, and not as <hi>wreck;</hi> for if any kind of <hi>Merchandiſe wreck'd,</hi> be ſubject to the Duty, all <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Book of Rates</hi> is?</p>
               <p>To reſolve this Queſtion I ſhall obſerve, That all <hi>wreck</hi> caſt on ſhoar in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> muſt be conceived as <hi>Goods Impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted;</hi> for though Goods <hi>Exported</hi> may be <hi>wreck'd</hi> at Sea equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Goods to be <hi>Imported,</hi> yet Goods <hi>Exported,</hi> if <hi>wreck'd,</hi> are not caſt upon any ſhoar of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> as <hi>wreck,</hi> under the notion of being <hi>Exported,</hi> but under the notion of being ſome way <hi>Imported.</hi>

               <p>And becauſe the Reſolution of this Caſe depends upon the words and intendment of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Twelfth of the King, c. 4.</hi> And that if any <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> in kind, ſubject to the Duties by that <hi>Act,</hi> proving <hi>wreck,</hi> caſt on ſhoar, may be charg'd with the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, every <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> within the <hi>Act,</hi> proving <hi>wreck,</hi> will be charg'd with it; and if any <hi>wreck'd Goods</hi> be free, all <hi>wreck'd Goods</hi> are free; for the <hi>Act</hi> makes no difference in the kinds or ſpecies of the <hi>Merchandiſe.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall therefore recite ſome Clauſes of the <hi>Act.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 Car. 2. c. 4</note> The firſt is, <hi>That there is given to the King, of every Tun of Wine of the growth of <hi>France,</hi> or of any the Dominions of the French King, that ſhall come into the Port of <hi>London,</hi> and the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by way of Merchandiſe by your natural born Subjects, the Sum of Four pounds and Ten ſhillings, of currant Engliſh mony, and ſo after that rate.

               <p>Nor are Goods which are brought to the <hi>Markets</hi> of the Kingdom to the end to be ſold, therefore to pay <hi>Cuſtome;</hi> for ſo all the Goods of the Kingdom would be cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but they muſt be Goods brought <hi>ab extra,</hi> within the intention of the <hi>Act,</hi> or for Exportation to be carried out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="5">

               <p>Therefore a Duty impoſſible to be known, can be no Duty; for civilly <hi>what cannot be known to be, is as that which is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is a poor ſhift to ſay, The Lord of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who hath the <hi>wreck,</hi> is Merchant Proprietor; For if ſo, I ask, Is he an Alien Merchant Proprietor, or a Native?</p>

               <p>If he be a natural Subject (as he muſt be, having his Mannor) he cannot be an <hi>Alien,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>King</hi> can have no <hi>Alien</hi> Duty of <hi>wreck'd Goods,</hi> but Goods intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Act</hi> to be charg'd with the Duty, might be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently the Goods of <hi>Aliens</hi> or <hi>Natives:</hi> But to clear this more, put the Caſe.</p>

               <p>Then the <hi>King</hi> could have had no Duty from <hi>wreck'd Goods</hi> at all, for they could not be the Goods of an <hi>Alien Merchant;</hi> Nor is <hi>wreck</hi> brought into the Mannor by the Lord, more than a Waif or Eſtray is, which if brought thither by him, is no Waif or Eſtray.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is clear, The <hi>Lord</hi> of a <hi>Mannor</hi> is no more a <hi>Merchant, Native or Alien,</hi> by reaſon of the property he hath in <hi>wreck Goods,</hi> than he is a <hi>Merchant, Native or Alien,</hi> by the property he hath in his <hi>Horſes</hi> or <hi>Cows;</hi> for his property in a <hi>wreck</hi> is not <hi>qua</hi> Merchant of any kind, but <hi>qua</hi> Lord of his <hi>Mannor;</hi> and every Proprietor of <hi>Goods,</hi> by what Title ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is as much Merchant as he.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It remains that ſome Objections be clear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is ſaid, That by <hi>fraud</hi> of the <hi>Merchant</hi> or his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> and the <hi>Lord of the Mannor,</hi> Goods not <hi>ſhipwrackt</hi> at all may be caſt overboard, ſo as to be caſt on ſhoar on the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> by the Tide, and ſo the <hi>Kings</hi> Duty avoided by confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Suppoſal is remote, and cannot be of ſome <hi>wrecks</hi> poſſible; as of <hi>wrecks of derelicted Goods,</hi> or of <hi>Goods caſt into the Sea</hi> to unburthen a Ship.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>fraud</hi> appear, there is no <hi>wreck,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> will be righted. But to charge a legal property which the <hi>Lord of the Mannor</hi> hath in a <hi>wreck</hi> with payments, becauſe a <hi>fraud</hi> may be poſſible, but appears not, will deſtroy all property, <hi>for what appears not to be, muſt be taken in Law as if it were not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Objection is, That the Kings Officers by uſage have had in ſeveral Kings times, the Duties of <hi>Tunnage and Poundage from wrecks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We deſired to ſee ancient <hi>Preſidents</hi> of that uſage, but could ſee but one in the time of <hi>King James,</hi> and ſome in the time of the <hi>laſt King,</hi> which are ſo new that they are not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Where the penning of a Statute is dubious, long uſage is a juſt medium to expound it by; For Jus &amp; Norma loquendi is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by uſage. And the meaning of things ſpoken or written muſt be, as it hath conſtantly been receiv'd to be by common Acceptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:99478:94"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if uſage hath been againſt the obvious meaning of an Act of Parliament, by the Vulgar and Common Acceptation of the Words, then it is rather an Oppreſſion of thoſe concern'd, than an Expoſition of the Act, eſpecially as the uſage may be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for inſtance, The <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> ſeize a mans Goods, under pretence of a Duty againſt <hi>Law; and thereby deprive him of the uſe of his Goods, until he regains them by Law,</hi> which muſt be by engaging in a Suit with the King rather than do ſo, he is content to pay what is demanded for the King. <hi>By this uſage</hi> all the Goods in the Land may be charg'd with the Duties of <hi>Tonnage and Poundage;</hi> for when the Concern is not great, moſt men (if put to it) will rather pay <hi>a little wrongfully,</hi> than free themſelves from it over-chargeably.</p>
               <p>And in the preſent Caſe, The genuine meaning of the words and purpoſe of the <hi>Act,</hi> is not according to the pretended uſage, but againſt it, as hath been ſhew'd: Therefore uſage in this Caſe weighs not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Objection is from the words <hi>Imported and brought into the Realm, or Dominions thereof,</hi> and that <hi>wrecks</hi> are Goods and Merchandiſes imported into the Realm, and therefore chargeable with the Duty.</p>
               <p>There are no Goods (as hath been ſaid) but may in a ſenſe be termed <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> becauſe all Goods may poſſibly be ſold, and when ſold, or intended to be, they are <hi>Merchandiſe;</hi> and in that ſenſe <hi>wreck'd Goods</hi> are <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> and ſo are all Goods elſe.</p>
               <p>It is alſo true, That the <hi>Goods in queſtion</hi> are by the Verdict found to be ſhipped in Forraign parts, as Merchandiſe, but not intended to be brought into <hi>England,</hi> but to be carried to ſome other Forraign parts (ſo are the words).</p>
               <p>But by the words, <hi>or ſome other Forraign parts,</hi> they might be intended to be carried as Merchandiſe <hi>into ſome Forraign parts, which are of the Kings Dominions, or of the Dominions of the Kingdom of England,</hi> for the <hi>Act</hi> mentions both.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Act</hi> limits the Duty, not upon Goods in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, but upon Goods brought by way of <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> by Natives or Aliens into any the Kings Dominions, which muſt be intended <hi>his Dominions, as of the Crown of England, for nothing could be enacted here concerning his Dominions, not of the Crown of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:99478:94"/>
               <p>But the Verdict is uncertain, <hi>Whether</hi> they were to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Forraign parts of the Dominions of England,</hi> or into parts not of <hi>the Dominion of England;</hi> nor follows it, becauſe Goods were intended to be ſold (that is, as Merchandiſe) in a place where good market was for them, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſold at any other place, where no profit could be made, or not ſo much, or where ſuch Goods were perhaps pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Commodities, therefore the words of the <hi>Act, brought as Merchandiſe,</hi> muſt mean that the Goods are for Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe at the place they are brought unto.</p>
               <p>And Goods brought or imported any where as Merchandiſe, or by way of Merchandiſe, that is, to be ſold, muſt neceſſarily have an Owner to ſet and receive the price for which they are ſold, unleſs a man will ſay, That Goods can ſell themſelves, and ſet and receive their own priſes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>wreck Goods</hi> imported or brought any where, have no Owner to ſell or prize them at the time of their importation, and therefore are <hi>not brought by way of, or as Merchandiſe to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or any where elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though in a looſe ſenſe, inanimate things are ſaid to bring things; as, <hi>in certain Seaſons, Rain to bring Graſs; in other Seaſons, ſome Winds to bring Snow and Froſt; ſome Storms to bring certain Fowl and Fiſh upon the Coaſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet when the bringing in or importing, or bringing out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, hath reference to Acts of Deliberation and Purpoſe, as of Goods for ſale, which muſt be done by a rational Agent, or when the thing brought, requires a rational bringer or importer;</hi> as be it a Meſſage, an Anſwer, an Accompt, or the like.

               <p>The Court was of Opinion in <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> that the naming of the <hi>Vill</hi> in the <hi>per nomen</hi> was not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>

               <p>The Court is of Opinion, notwithſtanding theſe Caſes, That in the preſent Caſe the <hi>per nomen</hi> is well enough, becauſe it is alledg'd the Grantor was ſeis'd of <hi>Two hundred</hi> Acres of Land in <hi>Kings Norton,</hi> whereof the <hi>locus in quo</hi> being <hi>Twenty</hi> Acres, is parcel: By reaſon whereof, the Rent being granted out of every parcel of the <hi>Two hundred</hi> Acres, it is well enough to ſay it was granted out of the <hi>Twenty</hi> Acres <hi>per nomen</hi> of all his Lands in <hi>Kings Norton;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Twenty</hi> Acres are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be parcel of all his Lands there, being <hi>Two hundred</hi> Acres.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Chapman's</hi> Caſe, It is not alledg'd that the <hi>Twenty</hi> Acres of Land demis'd were parcel of all the Tenements in <hi>S. per nomen,</hi> of which the <hi>Twenty</hi> Acres were to paſs.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Caſe of <hi>Gay,</hi> it was not poſſible that Lands granted, as in poſſeſſion ſhould paſs, <hi>per nomen,</hi> of Land, that was in Reverſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Exception is, Becauſe the Clauſe of Entry and Diſtreſs in the Deed upon <hi>Oyer</hi> of it, differs from the Clauſe of <hi>Entry and Diſtreſs</hi> alledg'd in the <hi>Conizance.</hi> For in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhould be lawful to Enter and Diſtrain if the rent were unpaid and behind after any of the Feaſts whereon it was due, that is, at any Feaſt that ſhould firſt happen after the death of <hi>Anne</hi> or <hi>Thomas Greaves,</hi> for the Rent did not commence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the Deed, <hi>If the Rent were behind at any the Feaſts, the Entry and Diſtreſs is made to be lawful for it, during the joynt Lives of <hi>Anne</hi> and <hi>Thomas Greaves</hi> the Uncle, and during their joynt lives,</hi> it could not be behind, for it commenc'd not till one of them were dead.</p>

                  <hi>BY the Act of</hi> 12 Car. 2. cap. 24. <hi>It is among other things Enacted,</hi> That where any perſon hath, or ſhall have, any Child or Children under the Age of One and twenty years, and not married at the time of his death, It ſhall and may be lawful to and for the Father of ſuch Child or Children, whether born at the time of the deceaſe of the Father, or at that time <hi>in ventre ſa mere;</hi> or whether ſuch Father be within the Age of One and twenty years, or of full Age, by his Deed executed in his life time, or by his laſt Will and Teſtament in writing, in the preſence of two or more credible Witneſſes, to diſpoſe of the cuſtody and tuition of ſuch Child or Children, for, and during ſuch time as he or they ſhall reſpectively remain under the Age of One and twenty years, or any leſſer time, to any perſon or perſons in poſſeſſion or remainder, other than Popiſh Recuſants: And ſuch diſpoſition of the Cuſtody of ſuch Child or Children made ſince the Four and twentieth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1645. or hereafter to be made, ſhall be good and effectual againſt all and every perſon or perſons claiming the cuſtody or tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Child or Children as Guardian in Soccage or otherwiſe: And ſuch perſon or perſons to whom the cuſtody of ſuch Child or Children hath been, or ſhall be ſo diſpoſed or deviſed as aforeſaid, ſhall and may maintain an Action of Raviſhment of Ward, or Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, againſt any perſon or perſons which ſhall wrongfully take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or detain ſuch Child or Children, for the Recovery of ſuch Child or Children, and ſhall and may recover Damages for the ſame in the ſaid Action, for the uſe and benefit of ſuch Child or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>And ſuch perſon or perſons to whom the cuſtody of ſuch Child or Children hath been, or ſhall be, ſo diſpoſed or deviſed, ſhall and may take into his or their cuſtody to the uſe of ſuch Child or Children, the profits of all Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments of ſuch Child or Children; and alſo the cuſtody, tuition, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99478:98"/> of the Goods, Chattels, and perſonal Eſtate of ſuch Child or Children, till their reſpective Age of One and twenty years, or any leſſer time, according to ſuch Diſpoſition aforeſaid; and may bring ſuch Action or Actions in relation thereto, as by Law a Guardian in Common Soccage might do.</p>
               <p>By the Will is deviſed in theſe words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do bequeath my ſon <hi>Thomas</hi> to my Brother <hi>Robert Towray</hi> of <hi>Rickhall,</hi> to be his Tutor during his Minority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before this <hi>Act, Tenant in Soccage</hi> of Age might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Land by Deed, or laſt Will, in truſt for his Heir, but not the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> and <hi>Tuition</hi> of his Heir; for the Law gave that to the next of Kinn, to whom the Land could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tenant</hi> in <hi>Soccage</hi> under Age, could not diſpoſe the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody</hi> of his Heir, nor deviſe or demiſe his Land in truſt for him in any manner. Now by this <hi>Statute</hi> he may grant the Cuſtody of his Heir, but cannot deviſe or demiſe his Land in truſt for him for any time <hi>directly;</hi> for if he ſhould, the deviſe or demiſe were as before the <hi>Statute</hi> (as I conceive) which is moſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>I ſay directly he cannot, but by a mean and obliquely he may; for nominating who ſhall have the Cuſtody, and for what time, by a conſequent the Land follows, as an <hi>incident</hi> given by the Law to attend the cuſtody, not as an <hi>Intereſt devis'd</hi> or <hi>demis'd</hi> by the party.</p>
               <p>This <hi>difference</hi> is very material; for if the Father could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Land in truſt for him until his Son came to <hi>One and twenty,</hi> as he can grant the Cuſtody then, as in other Caſes of Leaſes for years, the Land undoubtedly ſhould go to the Executor or Adminiſtrator of him whom the Father named, for the tuition, and the truſt ſhould follow the Land, as in other Caſes, where Lands are convey'd in truſt.</p>
               <p>But when he cannot, <hi>ex directo,</hi> deviſe the Land in truſt, then the Land follows the Cuſtody, and not the Cuſtody the Land; and the Land muſt go as the Cuſtody can go, and not the Cuſtody as the Land can go.</p>

               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:99478:98"/>
               <p>A ſecond Conſideration is, That by this Act no new cuſtody is inſtituted, but the office of Guardian, as to the duty and power of the place, is left the ſame, as the Law before had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd and ſetled of <hi>Guardian in Soccage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>modus habendi</hi> of that office is alter'd by this Act in <hi>two Circumſtances. The firſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be held for a longer time, <hi>viz. to the Age of the Heir of One and twenty,</hi> where before it was but to Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be by other perſons held, for before it was the next of Kindred, not inheritable, could have it, <hi>now who the Father names ſhall have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is, as if an Office grantable for life only before, ſhould be made grantable for years by <hi>Parliament,</hi> or grantable before to any perſon, ſhould be made grantable but to ſome kind of perſons only.</p>
               <p>The Office, as to the Duty of it, and its eſſence, is the ſame it was: But the <hi>Modus habendi</hi> alter'd.</p>
               <p>If therefore this new Guardian is the ſame in Office and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with the former Guardian in <hi>Soccage,</hi> and varies from it only in the <hi>Modus habendi,</hi> then the Ward hath the ſame legal Remedy againſt this Guardian as was againſt the old. But if this be a new Office of Guardianſhip, differing in <hi>its nature</hi> from the other, the Heir hath no remedy againſt him at all in Law; For though this new Guardian be enabled to have ſuch Actions as the old might have, yet this <hi>Act</hi> enables not the Heir to have like Actions, or any other againſt him, as he might againſt the Guardian in <hi>Soccage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Intent of this <hi>Statute</hi> is to priviledge the Father againſt common right to appoint the <hi>Guardian</hi> of his Heir, and the time of his Wardſhip under <hi>One and twenty:</hi> But leaves the Heirs of all other Anceſtors Wards in <hi>Soccage,</hi> as before: Therefore I hold,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſuch a <hi>Special Guardian</hi> cannot transferr the Cuſtody of the Ward by Deed or will to any other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he hath no different Intereſt from a <hi>Guardian in Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage,</hi> but for the time of the Wardſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> alte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the <hi>Common Law,</hi> the meaning ſhall not be ſtrained beyond the words, except in Caſes of publick Vtility, when the end of the <hi>Act</hi> appears to be larger than the enacting words. But by the words the <hi>Father only can appoint the Guardian,</hi> therefore the Guardian ſo appointed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not appoint another Guardian.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:99478:99"/>2. The Mother hath the ſame concern for her Heir, as the Father hath; But ſhe cannot by the <hi>Act</hi> name a <hi>Guardian,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſs can the Guardian named by the Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Father cannot by the <hi>Act</hi> give the cuſtody to a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but if it may be transferr'd over by him whom the Father names, or by Act in Law go to his Executor or Adminiſtrator, it may come to a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> againſt the meaning of the <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Offices or Acts of perſonal <hi>Truſt</hi> cannot be aſſign'd; for the Truſt is not perſonal which any man may have.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This Caſe likewiſe, and common Experience proves, That <hi>Guardian in Soccage</hi> cannot aſſign, nor ſhall the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> go to his <hi>Executors;</hi> though ſome <hi>ancient Books</hi> make ſome doubt therein.</p>
               <p>For expreſly by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 52 <hi>H.</hi> 3. the next of kin is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and be accomptable to the Heir in <hi>Soccage,</hi> as this ſpecial <hi>Guardian</hi> is here by <hi>Weſtminſter the Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Guardians</hi> truſted for the Heir, could neither aſſign their Cuſtody, nor did it go to their <hi>Executors,</hi> becauſe the Truſt was perſonal, and they had no Intereſt for themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Truſt is as perſonal in this new <hi>Guardian,</hi> nor hath he any Intereſt in it for himſelf; and therefore he ſhall not aſſign it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Guardian in Soccage</hi> cannot transferr his Cuſtody, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a perſonal Truſt, but the Truſt of this ſpecial <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> is more perſonal; therefore that he ſhall transferr it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſtrangely.</p>
               <p>The Office of a Philizer is an Office of <hi>perſonal Truſt</hi> to do the buſineſs of the <hi>Court,</hi> and not aſſignable,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. f. 7. Dyer.</note> no Execution can be upon it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George Reynels</hi> Caſe, an Office of Truſt and Confidence cannot be granted for years, becauſe then it might go to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (that is, to Executors or Adminiſtrators) never truſted or confided in.</p>
               <p>So is <hi>Littleton</hi> expreſly, That all Offices of Truſt,<note place="margin">Sect. 379.</note> as <hi>Steward, Conſtable, Bedlary, Bailiffwick,</hi> muſt be perſonally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, unleſs they be granted to be occupied by a <hi>Deputy,</hi> and are not aſſignable.</p>
               <p>And a more near or tenderer Truſt cannot be, than the Cuſtody and Education of a mans Child and Heir, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Eſtate.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, That in theſe Caſes the Law doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly appoint the <hi>Guardians,</hi> and therefore no others can be. But in the Caſe at Barr the Father appoints the perſon, not the Law.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is a difference in the Caſes, but not to make the Truſt more aſſignable in the one Caſe, than the other.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:99478:100"/>
               <p>Where the Law appoints who ſhall be truſted, the Truſt cannot be refuſed, as in the ſeveral <hi>Guardians</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>But where the Perſon names the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> the Truſt may be refuſed; but once accepted, it cannot be transfer'd to others, more than where the Law names the <hi>Truſtee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Executor hath a private office of Truſt (for we ſpeak not of publique) and is named by the Teſtator, not by the Law; therefore he may refuſe, but cannot aſſign his Executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>But it is true, an Executor may make an Executor (due Circumſtances obſerved) who ſhall diſcharge the firſt Teſtators Truſt, but the reaſon is, that after Debts paid, and Legacies, the <hi>Surplus</hi> of the Goods belongs to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, <hi>proprio jure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Adminiſtrator hath a private Office of Truſt, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſign nor leave it to his Executor, he is not named by the Inteſtate, but by the Law in part for him, but not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,</hi> he may not claim it if he will, becauſe it muſt paſs through the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>A mans Bailiff or Receiver are Offices of perſonal Truſt, and not aſſignable; ſo is the Office of every Servant.</p>
               <p>An Arbitrator, or one authorized to ſell a mans Land, to give <hi>Livery,</hi> or receive it, cannot aſſign; it is a perſonal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Cuſtody is not in its nature <hi>Teſtamentary,</hi> it cannot pay Debts nor <hi>Legacies,</hi> nor be diſtributed as <hi>Alms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not accomptable for to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> as Inteſtates Goods are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Heir ought to have a Guardian without interruption but an Executor may be long before he proves the Will, and may at length refuſe. An Adminiſtration, long before it be granted, and after, may be ſuſpended by Appeal; and in theſe times the <hi>Ward</hi> hath no certain Guardian reſponſal for his Eſtate or Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Shopland's C. 3 Jac. Cr. f. 99.</note>And where it may be ſaid, That theſe are naked Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and the perſons have no Intereſt, but a <hi>Guardian</hi> hath Intereſt, he may <hi>lett and ſett</hi> the <hi>Wards</hi> Land during minority, Avow in his own name, Grant Copy-hold Eſtates, and the like.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:99478:100"/>
               <p>It is an Intereſt conjoyned with his truſt for the <hi>Ward,</hi> (I ſpeak not here of equitable truſts, without which Intereſt he could not diſcharge the truſt) but it muſt be an Intereſt for himſelf, which is transferrable, or ſhall go to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor.</p>
               <p>All Executors and Adminiſtrators have <hi>Intereſt</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty neceſſary to their Truſts; for they may ſell the Goods or Leaſes of the Teſtator or Inteſtate, without which they could not execute the Truſt.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Monk</hi> made an Executor might do the like, who in his own right could have no Intereſt or Property.</p>
               <p>But ſuch Intereſt proves not that the Executors or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators may aſſign their Truſt,<note place="margin">Guardian in Soccage may demiſe his Guardianſhip and grant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Eſtate.

               <p>So as I take the ſenſe of the <hi>Act,</hi> collected in ſhort, to be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas all Tenures are now Soccage, and the next of kinn, to whom the Land cannot deſcend, is Guardian until the Heirs Age of Fourteen; yet the Father, if he will, may henceforth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Guardian to his Heir, and for any time, until the Heirs Age of One and twenty, and ſuch Guardian ſhall have like remedy for the Ward, as the Guardian in Soccage by the Common Law hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Expoſition</hi> of this <hi>Act</hi> hath been offer'd, as if the Father did deviſe his Land by way of Leaſe, during the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of the Heir, to him to whom he gave the Cuſtody in Truſt for the Heir, and ſo the Land was aſſignable over, and went to the Executors, but follow'd with the Truſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is a forc'd Expoſition to carry the Cuſtody to any Stranger, to the Father, or to the Child, or to any that may inherit the Land contrary to the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>excellent policy</hi> of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>As to the ſecond part;</p>
               <p>If the Father, being of Age, ſhould deviſe his Land to <hi>J. S.</hi> during the Minority of his Son and Heir, in truſt for his Heir, and for his Maintenance and Education, until he be of Age.</p>
               <p>This is no deviſing of the Cuſtody within this <hi>Statute,</hi> for he might have done this before the <hi>Statute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Father, under Age, ſhould make ſuch a Deviſe, it were abſolutely void; for the ſame ſyllables ſhall never give the Cuſtody of the Heir by the Father under Age, which do not give it by the Father which is of Age.</p>
               <p>But in both Caſes a Deviſe of the Cuſtody is effectual, and there is no reaſon that the Cuſtody devis'd ſhall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a Leaſe, when a Leaſe devis'd ſhall not operate into a Cuſtody, which it cannot do.</p>
               <p>If a man deviſe the Cuſtody of his Heir apparent to <hi>J. S.</hi> and mentions no time, either during his Minority, or for any other time, this is a good deviſe of the Cuſtody with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Act,</hi> if the Heir be under <hi>Fourteen</hi> at the death of the Father, becauſe by the Deviſe the <hi>Modus habendi Cuſtodiam</hi> is chang'd only as to the perſon, and left the ſame it was as to the time.</p>
               <p>But if above <hi>Fourteen</hi> at the Fathers death, then the Deviſe of the Cuſtody is meerly void for the incertainty.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:99478:101"/>
               <p>For the <hi>Act</hi> did not intend every Heir ſhould be in Cuſtody until <hi>One and twenty, Non ut tamdiu ſed ne diutius,</hi> therefore he ſhall be in this Cuſtody but ſo long as the Father appoints; and if he appoint no time, there is no Cuſtody.</p>
               <p>If a man have power to make Leaſes for any term of years, not exceeding <hi>One hundred,</hi> and he demiſes Land, but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no time, ſhall this therefore be a Leaſe for <hi>One hundred years?</hi> There is no Reaſon it ſhould be a Leaſe; for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt term he could grant, more than for the leaſt term he could grant, or indeed for any other term under <hi>One hundred:</hi> Therefore it is void for <hi>incertainty;</hi> and the Caſe is the ſame for the Cuſtody.</p>
               <p>For if the Father might intend as well any time under that, no Reaſon will enforce that he only intended that.</p>
               <p>And to ſay he intended the Cuſtody for ſome time, therefore ſince no other can be, it muſt be for that, will hold as well in the Leaſe, and in all other Caſes of incertainty. If a man deviſes <hi>Ten pounds</hi> to his Servant, but having many, none ſhall have it for the <hi>incertainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be demanded, If the Father appoint the Cuſtody until the Age of <hi>One and twenty,</hi> and the Guardian dye, what ſhall become of this Cuſtody?</p>
               <p>It determines with the death of the Guardian, and is a Condition in Law; and the ſame as if a man grant to a man the Stewardſhip of his Mannor for <hi>Ten</hi> years, or to be his Bailiff: It is implyed by way of <hi>Condition,</hi> if he live ſo long.</p>

               <p>That alters not the Caſe; for if he were <hi>Guardian in Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage</hi> without that particular power given by the <hi>Statute,</hi> he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <hi>Guardian in Soccage</hi> with it, and is no more than if the <hi>Statute</hi> had appointed <hi>Guardian in Soccage</hi> to have care of all the Eſtate of the Infant, however he came by it.</p>
               <p>Beſides that proves directly that this new Guardian doth not derive his intereſt from the Father, but from the Law; for the Father could never give him power or intereſt of or in that which was never his.</p>

I take it for clear, <hi>That a naked Tithe, granted by it ſelf pur auter vie, and the Grantee dying without aſſignment, living Ceſtuy que vie, is not capable of Occupancy,</hi> more than a <hi>Rent,</hi> a <hi>Common in groſs,</hi> and <hi>Advowſon in groſs,</hi> a <hi>Fair, or the like</hi> are, it being a thing lying in Grant equally as thoſe others do. <hi>Coke's Littleton; There can be no Occupant of any thing which lyeth in Grant, and cannot paſs without Deed.</hi> I cited the place at full before with other Authorities againſt Occupancy of a Rent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If a man dye ſeis'd of <hi>Land</hi> which he holds <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> and alſo dies ſeis'd of <hi>Rent</hi> held <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> or of an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon</hi> or <hi>Common in groſs,</hi> held by diſtinct Grants, <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Ceſtuy que vie,</hi> or the ſeveral <hi>Ceſtuy vies</hi> (for that will not differ the Caſe) living: Though the Grantee died ſeis'd of a Freehold in theſe ſeveral things, I conceive that he which enters into the <hi>Land</hi> firſt, after his death, will be <hi>Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> which was capable of <hi>Occupancy;</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Tithe, Advowſon,</hi> nor <hi>Common,</hi> which are not capable of <hi>Occupancy,</hi> and have no more coherence with, dependence upon, nor relation to, the <hi>Land,</hi> than if they had been granted <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> to another, who had happen'd to dye in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Grantee of the Land did.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:99478:106"/>
               <p>And that which hath intricated men in this matter, hath been a Conception taken up, <hi>as if the Occupant had for his object in being Occupant, the Freehold which the Tenant died ſeis'd of,</hi> which is a miſtake; for the <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>object</hi> of the <hi>Occupant</hi> are only ſuch things which are capable of <hi>Occupancy,</hi> not things which are not, and not the Freehold at all, into which he neither doth, nor can enter; but the <hi>Law</hi> caſts it immediately upon him that hath made himſelf <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> or other real thing whereof he is <hi>Occupant,</hi> that there may be a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to the <hi>Precipe.</hi> But, as was well obſerved by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Wilmott,</hi> No <hi>Precipe</hi> lies for ſetting out <hi>Tithe</hi> at <hi>Common Law;</hi> and I doubt not, by the <hi>Statute of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>though Sir Edward Coke in his Litt. f.</hi> 159. <hi>a. ſeems to be of opinion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coke Litt. 159. a.</note> 
                  <hi>that a man may at his Election have remedy for witholding Tithe, after that Statute, by Action or in the Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> by that <hi>Statute</hi> doubtleſs he hath for the title of <hi>Tithe</hi> as for title of <hi>Land,</hi> or for the taking of them away, but not <hi>perhaps</hi> for not ſetting them out.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When a Severance therefore is once made of the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Tithe,</hi> it is as much ſeverance of them, though the <hi>Tithe</hi> remain in <hi>Aſtly's</hi> poſſeſſion, as if he had leas'd the <hi>Land</hi> to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner,</hi> and the <hi>Tithe</hi> to another, if then <hi>Taverner</hi> becoming <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> ſhould have had nothing in the <hi>Tithe</hi> leas'd to another, as the <hi>Land</hi> was to him, no more ſhall he have the <hi>Tithe</hi> remaining in <hi>Aſtly</hi> himſelf at his death.</p>
               <p>Still we muſt remember the ground inſiſted on, That no <hi>Occupancy</hi> begins with the Freehold, but begins by <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> the <hi>Land,</hi> or other real thing, which was void and ownerleſs, and that by <hi>Act of Law</hi> the <hi>Freehold</hi> is caſt upon the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> either entring where the poſſeſſion was void, or being in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion when Tenant <hi>pur auter vie</hi> died, either as Leſſee for years, or at will to Tenant <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> equally caſts the Freehold upon him, as was reſolved in <hi>Chamberleyne</hi> and <hi>Eures</hi> Caſe, reported by <hi>Serjeant Rolls</hi> and others, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part. f.</hi> 151. <hi>Letter E.</hi> and in <hi>Caſtle and Dods Caſe,</hi> 5 <hi>Jac.

               <p>Therefore after ſuch Severance made by the Tenant <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Tithe</hi> are as diſtinct and ſunder'd from each other, as if <hi>Tenant pur auter vie</hi> had held them by diſtinct Grants, or leas'd them to diſtinct perſons.</p>

               <p>In the next place I ſhall agree,</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Occupant</hi> of a <hi>Houſe</hi> ſhall have the <hi>Eſtovers,</hi> or way pertaining to ſuch <hi>Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Demeſne</hi> of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> or of other <hi>Land,</hi> ſhall have the <hi>Advowſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant,</hi> or <hi>Villain regardant</hi> to the <hi>Mannor</hi> or <hi>Common</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Land,</hi> and the <hi>Services</hi> of the <hi>Mannor</hi> not ſever'd from the <hi>Demeſne</hi> before the <hi>occupancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of a <hi>Houſe, Land, Demeſne</hi> of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> as <hi>Occupant,</hi> doth not by ſuch his poſſeſſion ſever any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Land, Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Demeſne,</hi> more than the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> by any other title than <hi>occupancy</hi> doth; and if they be not ſever'd, it follows they muſt remain as before to the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of that to which they pertain.</p>
               <p>So if a <hi>Mannor,</hi> being an intire thing, conſiſting of <hi>Demeſnes</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> which are <hi>parts conſtituent</hi> of the <hi>Mannor;</hi> the poſſeſſing and occupancy of the <hi>Demeſns,</hi> which is one part, can make no ſeverance of the <hi>Services</hi> from the intire, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Occupant</hi> hath all.

                  <hi>Whatſoever paſſeth by Livery of Seiſin, either in Deed or in Law, may paſs without Deed, and not only the Rent and Services, parcel of the Mannor, ſhall, with the Demeſns, as the more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and worthy, paſs by Livery without Deed; but all things regardant, appendant, or appurtenant to the Mannor, as Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or Adjuncts to the ſame, ſhall, together with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, paſs without Deed, without ſaying cum pertinentiis.</hi> And if they paſs by <hi>Livery,</hi> which muſt be of the <hi>Land,</hi> they muſt likewiſe paſs by any lawful Entry made into the <hi>Land,</hi> and ſuch the Entry of the <hi>Occupant</hi> is.</p>
               <p>But as by <hi>occupancy</hi> of the <hi>demeſn Lands</hi> of a <hi>Mannor,</hi> the <hi>Services</hi> are not ſever'd; ſo if they be ſever'd at the time when the <hi>occupancy</hi> happens, that ſhall never of it ſelf <hi>unite</hi> them again.</p>
               <p>Now in the Caſe before us, The <hi>Tithe</hi> is neither <hi>appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> or <hi>appurtenant,</hi> or any ſort of <hi>Adjunct</hi> to the <hi>Glebe</hi> or <hi>Houſe,</hi> nor are they to the <hi>Tithe,</hi> nor will a leaſe and livery of the <hi>Glebe</hi> ſimply, with the <hi>appurtenances,</hi> paſs the <hi>Tithe</hi> at all, nor a Grant of the <hi>Tithe</hi> paſs the <hi>Glebe;</hi> nor are either
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99478:107"/> of them <hi>conſtituent parts</hi> of the <hi>Prebendary</hi> or <hi>Rectory,</hi> as the Services are of a <hi>Mannor;</hi> for a total ſeverance of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Demeſne deſtroy the <hi>Mannor,</hi> but a ſeverance of the <hi>Tithe</hi> or <hi>Glebe</hi> will not deſtroy the <hi>Rectory,</hi> more than the ſeverance of a <hi>Mannor, parcel</hi> of the poſſeſſions of a <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> will deſtroy the <hi>Biſhoprick;</hi> for the <hi>Glebe</hi> and the <hi>Tithe</hi> are but ſeveral poſſeſſions belonging to the <hi>Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is true, that in the Caſe before us, and like Caſes, a <hi>Grant</hi> of the <hi>Prebendary,</hi> or of the <hi>Rectory, una cum terra Glebali, &amp; decimis de Woolney,</hi> The <hi>Tithe,</hi> which alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs without Deed, doth paſs by Livery of the <hi>Rectory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Browlow, part. 2. f. 201.

               <p>Therefore the <hi>Tithe</hi> in ſuch Caſe muſt paſs in time by the Livery, which did not paſs without it, though granted by the Deed.</p>
               <p>Yet it is a Queſtion, Whether in ſuch Caſe the <hi>Tithe</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by the Livery or by the Deed? For though the paſſing it by Deed is ſuſpended by reaſon of the intention to paſs the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Tithe</hi> together, and not ſeverally, it follows not, but that the <hi>Tithe</hi> paſſeth by the Deed where Livery is given, though not until Livery given.</p>
               <p>If a man be ſeis'd of a <hi>Tenement of Land,</hi> and likewiſe of a <hi>Tithe,</hi> and agrees to ſell them both, and without Deed gives Livery in the Tenement to the Bargainee in name of it, and of the <hi>Tithe,</hi> I conceive the <hi>Tithe</hi> doth not paſs by that Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>But a <hi>Prebend</hi> or <hi>Church man</hi> cannot now by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 10. make a Leaſe of the poſſeſſions of his <hi>Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> without Deed.<note place="margin">13 Eliz. c. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Prebendary</hi> or <hi>Rectory</hi> is in truth neither the <hi>Glebe</hi> nor <hi>Tithe,</hi> nor both, for the one or the other may be recover'd, and might at Common Law have been aliened; the <hi>Rectory</hi> remaining. But the <hi>Rectory</hi> is the Church Parochial, whereof the <hi>Incumbent</hi> taketh the Cure and Seiſin by his <hi>Induction</hi> after his Inſtitution, which is his Charge, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99478:108"/> without other Seiſin then of the <hi>Ring</hi> or <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Church-door,</hi> by <hi>Induction</hi> into the <hi>Rectory</hi> the <hi>Parſon</hi> is ſeis'd of all the poſſeſſions belonging to his <hi>Rectory,</hi> of what kind ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>But though by the name of the <hi>Rectory</hi> the poſſeſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, of what nature ſoever, actually veſt in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent</hi> upon <hi>Induction,</hi> and may paſs from the <hi>Prebendary</hi> by <hi>Livery</hi> of the <hi>Prebend</hi> or <hi>Rectory</hi> to his Leſſee, according to the parties intention.</p>
               <p>Yet it follows not, That therefore an <hi>Occupant,</hi> who can be <hi>Occupant</hi> but of ſome <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> thing as <hi>Land</hi> is, ſhould, by being <hi>Occupant</hi> of that whereof occupancy may be, have thereby ſome other thing <hi>heterogene</hi> to the nature of <hi>Land,</hi> and not capable of occupancy, as a <hi>Tithe</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither <hi>appendant</hi> or <hi>appurtenant,</hi> or neceſſary part of that whereof he is <hi>Occupant;</hi> nor will it follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by giving Seiſin of the <hi>Rectory,</hi> the <hi>Tithe</hi> and <hi>Glebe</hi> belonging to it will paſs, that therefore giving <hi>Livery</hi> of the <hi>Glebe</hi> will paſs the <hi>Tithe.</hi> For it is obſervable, That if a man be <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> of a <hi>Mannor</hi> to which an <hi>Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is appendant, or of a Tenement to which a <hi>Common</hi> is belonging, and diſcontinue the Iſſue in tayl, ſhall never have the <hi>Advowſon</hi> or <hi>Common,</hi> until he hath recontinued the <hi>Mannor</hi> or <hi>Tenement.</hi>

               <p>And as to this Queſtion;</p>
               <p>If a Rent be granted to <hi>A.</hi> for the life of <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> dies, living <hi>B</hi> I conceive this Rent to be determined upon the death of <hi>A.</hi> equally, as if granted to him for his own life. I ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, becauſe it is not properly extinguiſh'd, nor is it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Extinguiſhment</hi> of a Rent is properly when the Rent is abſolutely conveyed to him, who hath the <hi>Land</hi> out of which the <hi>Rent</hi> iſſues; or the <hi>Land</hi> is convey'd to him to whom the <hi>Rent</hi> is granted.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Suſpenſion of a Rent</hi> is when either the <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Land</hi> are ſo convey'd, not <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>finally,</hi> but for a certain time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>Rent</hi> will be again reviv'd.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons why it is determined are, <hi>becauſe a thing ſo granted, as none can take by the Grant, is a void Grant,</hi> that is, as if no ſuch Grant had been. Therefore a Grant to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>L.</hi> and his Succeſſors, when there is no <hi>Biſhop</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time, or to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Pauls,</hi> or to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> of ſuch a place, when there is no <hi>Dean</hi> or <hi>Mayor</hi> living at the time of the Grant, is a void Grant, that is, as if it had not been, though ſuch a Grant by way of <hi>Remainder</hi> may be good. By the ſame Reaſon it follows, That when any thing is ſo granted, that upon ſome <hi>contingent</hi> hapning, none can take by the Grant, nor poſſibly have the thing granted, both the Grant, and thing granted, muſt neceſſarily determine; <hi>for what difference is there between ſaying that Rent can no longer be had, when it is determined by his death for whoſe life it was granted, and ſaying none can longer have this Rent when it determines by the death of the Grantee pur auter vie?</hi> For there is no <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee, Occupant,</hi> or any other, can poſſibly have it; and it is therefore determined.</p>

               <p>By this I hold it clear, That if a man demiſe <hi>Land</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Heirs <hi>habendum pur auter vie,</hi> or grant a Rent to a man and his Heirs, <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> though the Heir ſhall have this <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Rent</hi> after the Grantees death, yet he hath it not as a <hi>ſpecial Occupant</hi> (as the common expreſſion is) <hi>for if ſo, ſuch Heir were an Occupant, which he is not, for a ſpecial Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant muſt be an Occupant,</hi> but he takes it as Heir, not of a <hi>Fee,</hi> but of a <hi>deſcendible Freehold;</hi> and not by way of <hi>limitation,</hi> as a Purchaſe, to the Heir, but by deſcent, though ſome <hi>Opinions</hi> are that the Heir takes it by <hi>ſpecial limitation;</hi> as when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for life is made, the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> the Heir takes it by <hi>ſpecial limitation,</hi> if there be an Heir when the particular Eſtate ends. But I ſee not how, when <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Rent</hi> is granted to a man and his Heirs, <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> the Heir ſhould take by <hi>ſpecial limitation</hi> after the Grantees death, when the whole Eſtate was ſo in the firſt Grantee, that he might aſſign it to whom he pleas'd, and ſo he who was intended to take by <hi>ſpecial limitation</hi> after the Grantees death, ſhould take nothing at all.</p>
               <p>But to inherit as Heir a <hi>deſcendible Freehold,</hi> when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or other Anceſtor had not diſpos'd it, agrees with the <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Law,</hi> as appears by <hi>Bracton,</hi> which <hi>obiter</hi> in Argument is denied in <hi>Walſinghams</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Here it is evident, That <hi>Land</hi> granted to a man and his Heirs for the life of the Grantor, the <hi>Grantee</hi> dying in the life of the Grantor, the Heirs of the <hi>Grantee</hi> were to ſucceed him, and ſhould recover by a <hi>Writ of Mordanceſter</hi> in caſe of Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which infallibly proves the Heir takes by deſcent) who died ſeis'd as of a <hi>Fee,</hi> but not died ſeis'd in Fee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence I conclude, That if a man dye ſeis'd, <hi>pur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vie,</hi> of a <hi>Rent,</hi> a <hi>Tithe,</hi> an <hi>Advowſon in groſs, Common in groſs,</hi> or other thing, whereof there can be no <hi>Occupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> either directly or by conſequence, as <hi>adjuncts</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by the death of the <hi>Grantee,</hi> in all theſe Caſes the Grant is determined, and the Intereſt ſtands as before any Grant made.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:99478:110"/>2. If any man dye ſeis'd of <hi>Land, pur auter vie,</hi> as alſo of many of theſe things <hi>in groſs, pur auter vie,</hi> by diſtinct Grant from the <hi>Land.</hi> The <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> ſhall have none of theſe things, but they are in the ſame ſtate, and the Grants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine as if the Grantee had died ſeis'd of nothing whereof there could be any occupancy.</p>
               <p>But I muſt remember you, that in this laſt part of my Diſcourſe, where I ſaid, That if a <hi>Rent,</hi> a <hi>Tithe,</hi> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> or <hi>Advowſon in groſs,</hi> or the like, lying in Grant, were granted <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> and the Grantee died, living <hi>Ceſtuy que vie</hi> that theſe Grants were determin'd, my meaning was, and is, where ſuch <hi>Rent, Tithe,</hi> or other things, are ſingly granted, and not where they are granted, together with <hi>Land,</hi> or any other thing out of which Rent may iſſue, with <hi>Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of a Rent out of the whole.</p>
               <p>For although a Rent cannot iſſue out of things which lye in Grant, as not diſtrainable in their nature, yet being granted together with <hi>Land,</hi> with reſervation of a <hi>Rent,</hi> though the Rent iſſue properly and only out of the <hi>Land,</hi> and not out of thoſe things lying in Grant, as appears by <hi>Littleton;</hi> yet thoſe are part of the Conſideration for payment of the <hi>Rent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cok. Litt. f. 142. a. 144. a.</note> as well as the <hi>Land is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch caſe when the <hi>Rent</hi> remains ſtill payable by the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupant,</hi> it is unreaſonable that the Grant ſhould determine as to the <hi>Tithe,</hi> or as to any other thing lying in Grant, which paſſed with the <hi>Land</hi> as part of the Conſideration for which the Rent was payable, and remain to the Leſſor as before they were granted; for ſo the Leſſor gives a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for paying a <hi>Rent</hi> which he enjoys, and hath not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Conſideration given back again.</p>
               <p>And this is the preſent Caſe, being ſtript and ſingled from ſuch things as intricate it: That Doctor <hi>Mallory, Prebend</hi> of the <hi>Prebendary</hi> of <hi>Woolney,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Glebe-land,</hi> a <hi>Houſe, Barns,</hi> and <hi>Tithe</hi> of <hi>Woolney,</hi> and thereof ſeis'd in the right of his <hi>Prebendary,</hi> makes a Leaſe to <hi>Aſtly</hi> of the <hi>Prebend. una cum</hi> the <hi>Glebe, Houſe, Barn,</hi> and <hi>Tithe</hi> for <hi>Three Lives,</hi> rendring the accuſtomed and ancient Rent of <hi>Five pounds Twelve ſhillings: Aſtly</hi> demiſeth to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:99478:110"/> the <hi>Houſe, Glebe,</hi> and <hi>Barn</hi> for a year, reſerving <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings,</hi> and dies, the <hi>Ceſtuy que vies</hi> living.</p>
               <p>As I concluded before, <hi>Taverner</hi> is <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Houſe, Barn,</hi> and <hi>Glebe-land,</hi> and conſequently lyable to pay the whole Rent, being <hi>Five pounds twelve ſhillings</hi> yearly, though the <hi>Land, Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Barn</hi> be found of the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value of <hi>Twenty ſhillings</hi> only; but becauſe the Rent cannot iſſue out of <hi>Tithes,</hi> or things that lye in Grant, it iſſues only out of the <hi>Houſe, Barn,</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> which may be diſtrain'd on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Taverner,</hi> being <hi>Occupant</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> ſhall not have the <hi>Tithes</hi> which remain'd in <hi>Aſtly,</hi> according to his <hi>Leaſe</hi> for three Lives at the time of his death, and whereof by their nature there can be no direct Occupancy. It follows, that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> made by Doctor <hi>Mallory</hi> is determin'd as to the <hi>Tithe,</hi> for no other can have them; yet continues in force as to the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Houſe,</hi> and all the Rent reſerv'd, which ſeems ſtrange, the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Tithe</hi> being granted by the ſame Demiſe for <hi>three</hi> Lives, which ſtill continue: yet the <hi>Leaſe</hi> to be determined as to part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the Rent iſſue not out of the <hi>Tithe,</hi> yet the <hi>Tithe</hi> was as well a Conſideration for the payment of the Rent, as the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> were; and it ſeems unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> Doctor <hi>Mallory,</hi> ſhould by act in Law have back the greateſt Conſideration granted for payment of the <hi>Rent,</hi> which is the <hi>Tithe,</hi> and yet have the <hi>Rent</hi> wholly out of the Land by act in Law too, which cannot yield it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though Doctor <hi>Mallory</hi> could not have reſerv'd a <hi>Rent</hi> out of the <hi>Tithe</hi> only, to bind his Succeſſor upon a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for Lives, more than out of a <hi>Fair,</hi> though it were as the ancient <hi>Rent,</hi> and had been uſually anſwered for the <hi>Fair;</hi> as is reſolv'd in <hi>Jewel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarum's</hi> Caſe:<note place="margin">Jewell's Caſe 5 Rep.</note> Yet in this Caſe, where the <hi>Tithe,</hi> together with <hi>Land,</hi> out of which <hi>Rent</hi> could iſſue was demis'd; for the accuſtomed <hi>Rent,</hi> the Succeſſor could never avoid the <hi>Leaſe,</hi> either in the whole, or as to the <hi>Tithe</hi> only.</p>

               <p>There was a time when the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> had no Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of lawful or unlawful marriages; ſo was there a time when the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> had no Conizance of <hi>matters Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary</hi> and <hi>probat of Wills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Henſloes C. 9.

               <p>Notwithſtanding it will be ſaid, They want knowledge or skill in the Law by which it muſt be determined what are, or are not, the <hi>Levitical Degrees;</hi> for they are not ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Divine Law, they want skill in the Original in which it was written, and in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> by which it is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted.</p>
               <p>As <hi>ſpecious</hi> as this ſeems, it is a very empty Objection; for no man is ſuppoſed neceſſarily ignorant of a Law which he is bound to obſerve. It is irrational to ſuppoſe men neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of thoſe Laws, for breach of which they are to be puniſht, and therefore no <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Human Law,</hi> ought to be ſuppoſed unknown to them, who muſt be puniſht for <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing</hi> them. We are obliged not to marry in the prohibited Degrees, not to be <hi>Heretical, or the like;</hi> therefore we are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know both.</p>
               <p>Nor is it an Exception to diſable a man of having any Church Dignity whatever, that he is not knowing in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek Tongue.</hi> All <hi>States</hi> receive the Scriptures in that Language wherein the ſeveral States think fit to publiſh them for common uſe; and it is but very lately that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches</hi> have become knowing in the Original Tongues wherein the Scriptures were written; which is not a knowledge of <hi>obligation,</hi> and required in all, or any, but <hi>acknowledged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, and enjoy'd by ſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were enacted by Parliament, That matters of <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> of <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> ſhould be determined in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> according to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> this Objection would not ſtand in the way, no more can it in this particular concerning <hi>Inceſtuous marriages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Laws of one people have frequently been transferred over and become the Laws of another: As thoſe of the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> in like manner thoſe Laws of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> for Maritime Affairs, made the Law of the <hi>Romans;</hi> the Laws of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Ireland:</hi> and many ſuch might be inſtanced.</p>
               <p>As another lymn of this Objection, it is ſaid, This <hi>Act</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſeems rather a directing <hi>Act,</hi> how the <hi>Courts Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> ſhould proceed touching marriages out of the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> than an <hi>Act</hi> impowering the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit their proceeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the King's Laws prohibit any thing to be done, there are regular ways to puniſh the Offender: As for common Offences by Indictment or Information. Erronious Judgments are remedied
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99478:113"/> by Writs of Error or Appeal. Incroaching Juriſdiction by Courts where no Writ of Error lies, is corrected by the King's Writs of Prohibitions.</hi> It is moſt proper for the King to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the violating of his Laws, by impeaching of marriages which the Law will not have impeach'd, by incroaching Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as to hinder them from impeaching or drawing into <hi>queſtion</hi> Contracts for Lands, or other things whereof they have not Conizance. And the King hath never otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied that fault againſt his Laws, but by his <hi>Prohibitions</hi> out of his Courts of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Nor is it conſonant to Law or common Reaſon, That they who offend, by <hi>incroaching Juriſdiction</hi> againſt Law, ſhould be the redreſs allowed by Law only againſt ſuch incroachment, which were to provide againſt doing wrong by him who doth it.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Act,</hi> no perſon of what eſtate or condition ſoever,<note place="margin">Rep. 1, 2. p.m. but that was Rep. again 1 El. c. 1.</note> is to be admitted to any of the <hi>Spiriual Courts,</hi> and to any <hi>Proceſs, Plea,</hi> or <hi>Allegation,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Act</hi> therefore never intended the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts</hi> ſhould have any <hi>Judicial power</hi> to determine or <hi>judge</hi> what marriages were within or without the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or not contrary to the <hi>Act,</hi> when it admits not any <hi>Proceſs, Plea,</hi> or <hi>Allegation</hi> in a <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is impoſſible that Court ſhould have Conizance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of a marriage, which is forbid to admit <hi>Proceſs, Plea,</hi> or <hi>Allegation</hi> againſt ſuch marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, if it be lawful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This marriage not prohibited in the 18. <hi>of Leviticus,</hi> nor the ſame degree with any there prohibited.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If marriages, neither prohibited <hi>in terminis</hi> in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> nor being in the ſame degree with a marriage there prohibited ſhould be unlawful, there would be no ſtop or <hi>terminus</hi> of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful marriages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The 20. <hi>of Leviticus</hi> prohibits no other marriages than the 18. <hi>of Leviticus</hi> doth, but appoints the puniſhments, which the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> doth not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not now to determine, Whether the marriages menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned within <hi>Leviticus</hi> 18. be only prohibited, or marriages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the degrees there mentioned: The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> hold the firſt; the <hi>Karaits</hi> the ſecond ſtrongly: who in moſt concurr <hi>with our Parochial Table.</hi>

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:99478:114"/>5. This marriage not prohibited by the <hi>Canons</hi> 1 <hi>Jac. Can.</hi> 99. nor contained in the <hi>Parochial Table.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Marriages between the Children and Parents in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending line <hi>intermediately</hi> prohibited; and for what Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="7">7. How the words <hi>(Gods Law except)</hi> in the <hi>Act of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the words <hi>(or otherwiſe by Holy Scripture)</hi> in the <hi>Act of</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 16. are to be intended.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Defendant</hi> doth not Article, That the Vncle, <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Abbot,</hi> did carnally know <hi>Jane</hi> his wife, and then the marriage is not againſt Gods Law, by 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7</p>
               <p>The miſchief by the <hi>Act of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was, That the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> had always troubled the meer Iuriſdiction and Regal Power of the <hi>Realm of England,</hi> and unquieted the Subject by making that unlawful, which by Gods word is lawful, both in marriages and other things.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is thought convenient for this time, that <hi>two things be with diligence provided for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt was againſt diſſolution of marriages conſummate with bodily knowledge, upon pretence of Pre-contracts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other by reaſon of other prohibitions, to marry than Gods Law admitteth; As in Kindred or Affinity between Coſen Germans, and ſo to the fourth and fifth Degree; which elſe were lawful, and be not prohibited by Gods Law. —Again, that freedom in them was given by Gods Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To remedy theſe <hi>two</hi> miſchiefs, <hi>All marriages conſummate with bodily knowledge between lawful perſons, and all perſons are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be lawful to marry which be not prohibited by Gods Law, are made lawful by Authority of Parliament, notwithſtanding any Prae-contract, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this part of the Clauſe to make good marriages not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding pre-contracts, is repeal'd, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 23. 1 <hi>El. c.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The other Clauſe remains, which declares all perſons lawful to marry who are not prohibited by Gods Law, but is of no uſe to remedy the ſecond miſchief.</p>
               <p>For if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall expound what perſons of <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> or <hi>Affinity</hi> are prohibited by Gods Law to marry, he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Gods Law as the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> formerly did.</p>
               <p>That by the <hi>Word of God</hi> no man is to uncover the <hi>nakedneſs</hi> of the <hi>Kindred of his Fleſh, and therefore marriage is prohibited</hi> as farr as there are names of Kindred and memory, which is the reaſon of the <hi>Old Canon Law</hi> to prohibit to the <hi>Seventh Degree,</hi> for further they had not names of Kindred. And if it would have remedied the Inconvenience, to ſay in the <hi>Act,</hi> That all
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99478:114"/> marriages were lawful, not prohibited by Gods Law, and <hi>leave the Pope</hi> then to <hi>reſolve</hi> what was prohibited by Gods Law, it was to no purpoſe to have added more words to the <hi>Act,</hi> but to have ended ther, and the inconvenience of prohibiting mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, for <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> or <hi>Affinity, when God did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit,</hi> had ſtill remain'd.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Act</hi> goes on, <hi>And that no Prohibition or Reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (Gods Law except) ſhould impeach any marriage for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity or Affinity, for ſo it muſt be underſtood without the Levitical Degrees, for that was the ſecond thing ſpecially to be provided for;</hi> as the <hi>Act</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>Not that no marriage ſhould be impeached without the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Degrees,</hi> which the <hi>Act</hi> intended not at all, nor was it the thing to be provided for, but not to be impeached for <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> or <hi>Affinity</hi> without the <hi>Levitical Degrees;</hi> as in <hi>Coſen Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>For who will ſay, That by thoſe words <hi>no marriage ſhall be impeached without the Levitical Degrees,</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> intended that no marriage for <hi>natural Impotency,</hi> for <hi>plurality of Husbands or Wives for Adultery, and the like,</hi> ſhould not be impeached, though it were out of the <hi>Levitical Degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Act</hi> had no aſpect upon ſuch <hi>marriages,</hi> but to hinder impeaching <hi>marriages</hi> for <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> or <hi>Affinity,</hi> without the <hi>Levitical Degrees, which was the ſecond thing by the Act, to be at that time diligently provided for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore thoſe words, <hi>Gods Law except, muſt referr to ſuch other marriages, as by Gods Law</hi> might be impeach'd, and not to any for <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> or <hi>Affinity,</hi> for had not thoſe words been the generality of the <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> No <hi>marriage</hi> ſhall be impeach'd without the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> had excluded the impeaching mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages for plurality of <hi>Wives</hi> or <hi>Husbands,</hi> at a time for <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> and for <hi>Adultery,</hi> as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> obſerves, at the end of his <hi>Comment</hi> upon this <hi>Statute in his Second Inſtitutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if thoſe words, No <hi>marriage</hi> ſhall be impeach'd, <hi>Gods Law except,</hi> ſhall be underſtood, That no marriage ſhould be impeach'd, not prohibited by the Scripture, <hi>viz. Gods Law.</hi> Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was no uſe of naming the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> at all.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:99478:115"/>2. The <hi>Pope</hi> would have interpreted the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which belong'd to him) to have prohibited all marriages between Kindred, as anciently, and then the end of the <hi>Act</hi> had been fruſtrate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherein was the Kings Iurisdiction and Regal Power righted, if prohibiting of marriage for <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> or <hi>Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> were to be proceeded in as formerly.</p>
               <p>But all <hi>marriages</hi> without the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> being made lawful, becauſe the Secular Iudges by the <hi>Act</hi> of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. had certain <hi>Conizance</hi> of them both expreſly, and in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they were no more of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conizance</hi> than Contracts concerning <hi>Land</hi> or <hi>Lay Chattels</hi> were, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the queſtioning of them to be prohibited as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This was to complain of the <hi>Pope</hi> as a wrong doer againſt the Law of God, <hi>viz. Holy Scripture,</hi> and diligently to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide remedy for it according to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereof the wrong doer was the only deciſive and infallible Interpreter, as the <hi>Church</hi> then believed: which is redreſſing a wrong by the Iudgment of the wrong doer.</p>
               <p>Anciently, before any <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> alter'd the Law, the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>marriages,</hi> and which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous, which not, were only of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conuzance,</hi> and the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> medled not to ratifie or prohibit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>marriage.</hi>

There was no time wherein ſome marriages were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and others unlawful, but the Iudgment of both was <hi>meerly Eccleſiaſtick;</hi> inſomuch, That if a man were queſtion'd in the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> for a lawful marriage, the <hi>Temporal Law</hi> would afford him no <hi>Remedy by Prohibition,</hi> or otherwiſe, becauſe they neither had any Iuriſdiction of that Subject matter, nor were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have any knowledge in thoſe Laws, by which ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were to be determined, which were the <hi>Laws of God,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> either by <hi>Councils,</hi> or the <hi>Popes Decretals</hi> admitted in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

               <p>Becauſe the lawfulneſs ſtill depended upon the <hi>Law Divine,</hi> and the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> as then it ſtood by that alteration whereof the <hi>Secular Judges</hi> had no <hi>Conuzance</hi> or Skill to Iudge; nor is there any <hi>Prohibition</hi> in the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> or elſewhere to be found, concerning the <hi>queſtioning</hi> of any <hi>marriage</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> in all the time preceding the <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> nor long after ſome of them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That by neither of theſe <hi>Acts,</hi> no marriage prohibited before, either by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> or the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> differenc'd from it is made lawful.</p>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. Neither of theſe <hi>Acts</hi> ſay or declare, That the Degrees rehears'd in the ſaid <hi>Acts,</hi> and thereby declared to be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> are all the Degrees of marriage prohibited by <hi>Gods Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For take the words at moſt advantage for that purpoſe, <hi>viz. Since many inconveniences have fallen by marrying within the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees prohibited by Gods Law. That is to ſay,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Son to marry the Mother, the Brother the Siſter, &amp;c. and that the enumeration in the Act of prohibited Degrees,</hi> had gone no further than to the <hi>Degrees of Conſanguinity,</hi> not enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any <hi>Degrees of Affinity;</hi> as then it had been no Inference to conclude that there were no more prohibited Degrees by <hi>Gods Law</hi> intended by the <hi>Statute,</hi> than the <hi>Degrees of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>So now no Degrees being mentioned in the <hi>Statute</hi> to be prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> but thoſe which are expreſs'd, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thence be concluded, That the <hi>Statute</hi> intended no other than thoſe to be prohibited by <hi>Gods Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thoſe are therefore mentioned to be prohibited, becauſe they were Degrees ſignally expreſſed, and concerning which no queſtion or doubt could be made.</p>

                  <p>In the ſame manner is it if a <hi>Statute</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Since many Inconveniences have happen'd, by doing things prohibited by the Kings Laws; that is to ſay, By Depopulation of Farms, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of Tithes, by committing Dilapidations, and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things forbidden by the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would not be concluded, That the things ſo enumerated, were all the things <hi>prohibited</hi> by the <hi>Kings Laws,</hi> no more can it that the enumerated Degrees of prohibited Marriages in the <hi>Act</hi> by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> are all the Degrees by <hi>Gods Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this Law all Marriages made before that <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. no <hi>divorce</hi> being had, are made good and lawful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>But the Act going further, and ſaying, <hi>Prohibited by Gods Law, limited in the Act of</hi> 28. <hi>or otherwiſe by Holy Scripture,</hi> leaves, as is objected, all Conuzance of Marriages as before, to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> though not ſo amply.</p>
                  <p>So by thoſe added words, <hi>Or otherwiſe by holy Scripture,</hi> the Act made all Marriages ſolemnized before that time, not prohibited by <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> good and lawful; by which Act, though Marriages prohibited only by the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> divided from <hi>Scripture,</hi> were made good.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:99478:118"/>
                  <p>Yet the tryal was, Whether the Marriage was prohibited by Holy Scripture? which being only of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Conizance,</hi> they only could judge of the lawfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>And that the Temporal Courts could by that Act no more judge what <hi>Marriage</hi> was <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>Inceſtuous</hi> by the Holy Scripture, than what was <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Hereſie</hi> by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By this Act it is evident, The <hi>Law-makers</hi> thought ſome Marriages were, or might be prohibited by Gods Law, not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Act of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>So if the Act had limited all Marriages lawful, but thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the <hi>Five Books of Moſes,</hi> or in the <hi>Book of Moſes</hi> called <hi>Leviticus;</hi> though the unlawfulneſs of Marriage had been more reſtrain'd under that expreſſion, than under the general expreſſion of <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> Yet</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Books being part of Holy Scripture, the Secular Iudges had no more Conuzance of the parts than of the whole.</p>
                  <p>And ſo would it have been if the Act had reſtrained the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of <hi>Marriage</hi> to the <hi>Eighteenth Chapter of Leviticus,</hi> that being a part of the <hi>Book</hi> called <hi>Leviticus,</hi> the Temporal Courts could have no more Conuzance of that part or <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Book,</hi> than of the <hi>whole Book.</hi> This I think is the full of the Objection.</p>
                  <q>The laſt Law, and which is <hi>Cardo Queſtionis,</hi> as being pleaded by the Plaintiff <hi>Harriſon</hi> in the Books, is the Act of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. conſiſting of ſeveral parts,<note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 28.</note> ſome whereof are <hi>Repeal'd;</hi> as the branch concerning <hi>Pre-contracts.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſhall therefore examine that Act as it ſtands in force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Marriages between <hi>Coſen Germans,</hi> and all Marriages onwards between <hi>Collateral Coſens,</hi> which were prohibited very far, before the <hi>Council of Lateran,</hi> and ſince it, thoſe to the fourth Degree, to the making of this Act, are made <hi>lawful,</hi> and declared not to be againſt the Law of God, <hi>viz,</hi> in theſe words, —<hi>And be not prohibited by Gods Law.</hi>

                  <p>So if any Marriage within thoſe Degrees ſhall be queſtioned as Inceſtuous in the <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> a <hi>Prohibition</hi> will lye upon this Act, becauſe the <hi>Marriages,</hi> by one part of the Act, are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red expreſly,</p>

                  <p n="2">2. By another, All Marriages contracted between lawful perſons, as we declare all <hi>perſons</hi> to be <hi>lawful</hi> that are not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited</hi> by Gods Law to marry, are lawful.</p>

                  <p>But theſe <hi>Marriages</hi> concern not the Caſe in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Clauſe</hi> in the Act, and upon which the preſent Caſe ſtands,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That no Reſervation or Prohibition (Gods Law except) ſhall trouble or impeach any Marriage without the Levitical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The clear ſenſe of which Clauſe muſt be, <hi>That all Marriages are lawful, which are not prohibited within the Levitical Degrees, or otherwiſe by Gods Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as the prohibiting of Marriages within the <hi>Levitical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> and within <hi>Gods Law,</hi> whereof the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> are a part, is no more or leſs <hi>in effect,</hi> than to ſay, All Marriages ſhall be lawful that <hi>Gods Law</hi> doth not prohibit.</p>
                  <p>Whence is collected, That of <hi>Gods Law</hi> in general, or of the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> in particular, being a part of that <hi>Law,</hi> the Temporal Iudges had no Conuzance after this Act more than before, and that this Act, excepting in the matter of Marriages to the <hi>fourth Degree,</hi> and <hi>onwards,</hi> which it declares not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gods Law,</hi> was only directory to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> as the former <hi>Statutes</hi> were, and gave the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> no Iuriſdiction to prohibit queſtioning any Marriage but thoſe of <hi>Coſen Germans</hi> and <hi>onwards.</hi>

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:99478:119"/>
                  <p>But the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> have long ſince, and often, after the Act of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. granted <hi>Prohibitions</hi> for queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning marriages out of the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the lawfulneſs of ſuch <hi>Prohibitions.</hi>

                     <p>To this may be added, That children from nature know not their parents or kindred from other people, and therefore their <hi>Acts,</hi> whatever they be, whether of marriage or otherwiſe, are (regarding nature only) as indifferent towards their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Kindred,</hi> as towards any other men or women.</p>

                  <head>How things become unnatural by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</head>
                  <p>A ſecond way by which mens Acts are ſaid to be unnatural (and are ſo in ſome meaſure) is, <hi>When Laws Divine or Humane, do ſupervene upon mans original nature with great penalty for tranſgreſſing them. Mens education, <hi>à teneris Annis,</hi> to obſerve thoſe Laws, the infamy attending their violation, and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cuſtomary obſervance of them, implant a horrour and averſneſs to break them; ſo that by long cuſtome they are not obſerv'd, only to avoid the puniſhment, and as things which were otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but are obſerved, from an averſneſs and loathing, begot by Cuſtome, to tranſgreſs them. That though men were ſecure from the puniſhment, if they broke them, yet Nature denies all appetite and inclination to violate them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kind of ſecondary Nature is eminently ſeen in mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs from ſome things for Food, which Cuſtome had made deteſtable. As eating the <hi>Fleſh of Men, Bears, Horſes, Dogs, Cats,</hi> and many other things which nauſeate men, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffenſive upon no other account than that Cuſtome hath made them ſo, not primitive Nature, and which upon tryals of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> have been found both <hi>eatable</hi> and <hi>nouriſhing;</hi> and by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cuſtome among ſome other <hi>Nations</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> are as deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as other Food, as is exampled in the <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi> or <hi>Men-eaters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſecondary way, the <hi>Copulation</hi> with the Mother, Siſter, and the like, do become odious and reluctant to Nature, and generally are ſo where <hi>Humanity</hi> is well planted, which in the original ſtate of nature, and without thoſe induc'd <hi>Laws, Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of <hi>Manners,</hi> had been as indifferent as with
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99478:121"/> other women. To this purpoſe there is a paſſage, and a true one, in <hi>Simplicius,</hi> ſpeaking when the <hi>Grecians</hi> began to deſert their Inceſtuous marriages. — <hi>Jam cum lex &amp; conſuetudo,</hi>

                  <p>And for this are the <hi>Egyptians</hi> upbraided in the Prophets <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> for their <hi>Beſtiality,</hi> in <hi>Copulation</hi> with their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Relations;</hi> as is moſt frequent in Story.</p>

In this way it is true, that ſuch <hi>Inceſtuous</hi> marriages are unnatural, and ſo never made by thoſe in whom Cuſtome hath begot a horror and averſion to them; but on the other ſide, to them which have it not, there is no unnaturalneſs in them; for Nature originally hath not implanted that averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, nor Cuſtome prevailed to beget it, as it hath in the others.</p>

                  <p>A third way of mens acting unnaturally is, when they violate Laws coeval with their <hi>original being,</hi> though the Laws be but <hi>poſitive Divine,</hi> or <hi>poſitive Human Laws,</hi> and not of nature, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, nor in any other ſenſe, intelligible to be <hi>Natural Laws.</hi> But that they bind men as ſoon as men can be bound, and no Law can poſſibly precede them.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon of their being natural Laws properly, is, becauſe mans nature muſt neceſſarily aſſent to receive them as ſoon as it is capable of aſſenting, and hath no power to diſſent from them; for a man hath no power to diſſent from, or not to aſſent to his own preſervation, or not to diſſent from his own deſtruction: But not to aſſent to the will, that is, to the Laws, of an Infinite Power, to hurt and benefit, is, to aſſent to his own deſtruction and infinite hurt, and to diſſent from his own preſervation and infinite benefit; <hi>for infinite power can hurt or benefit as it pleaſeth.</hi> Therefore to aſſent to the Laws of the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is natural to man.</p>

                  <p>And as to <hi>Adams</hi> Sons marrying their Siſters by the ſame Mother, the Law was given in the beginning prohibiting it, but God diſpens'd with it until the World was competently peopled, as they receive it.</p>

                  <p>There is a <hi>fourth</hi> way whereby a man is ſaid to act unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, which acting is ſubſequent to Human Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts between man and man, which is, when after Laws made, and Contracts civilly ſetled, a man ſhall oblige himſelf dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrally repugnant, and contrary to his former Obligation. As when</p>
                  <p>A Subject ſhall by Oath promiſe, or otherwiſe bind himſelf, to judge or force his King, when by his Obligation to his King, he is bound to obey him, and be judg'd by him.</p>
                  <p>When a Servant ſhall command and compel his Maſter, by whom he ought to be commanded.</p>
                  <p>To contract marriage with two Husbands, when plenary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obedience is to be paid to each; and therefore impoſſible to be performed to both.

                  </p>
                  <p>As the Father is prohibited to marry his Daughter, his Sons daughter, and his Daughters daughter, and further, the <hi>Levitical Prohibition</hi> for nearneſs of Kin, and for the reſpects before, extends not.</p>

                  <p>For the State being diſſolved, there is no <hi>lawful Coercion</hi> left for keeping, nor puniſhment for violating the Laws and where that is not, there is no Law common to that people: For without coercion and puniſhment, every man is free, that is, he is not bound to any Law of Community, at leaſt.

                  <p>It is hence not improbable the <hi>Jews</hi> had great averſneſs to the Communion of ſuch, whoſe mixtures in marriage were alike to theſe Nations, though they were not of theſe Nations; for the vengeance ordained againſt them appears not to be for other cauſes (than for thoſe <hi>inceſtuous Copulations</hi>) which were not common to all other the Nations of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as well as to them, that is <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> might direct the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to abſtain from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages that would render them odious to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever after continued as moſt conformant to <hi>Gods will</hi> in the fitneſs of marriage.</p>
                  <p>But this is not reaſon enough to make all theſe marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be prohibited to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> abſolutely by <hi>Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> as unholy in themſelves, without relation to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo as to make it abſolutely unlawful to change them by any Humane Law upon any occaſion. <hi>But it is never prudent to change a Law which cannot be better'd in the ſubject matter of the Law.</hi>

                  <p>The third Queſtion, and chiefly concerning the Caſe in queſtion, is, Whether <hi>Harriſon's</hi> marriage with his great Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (that is, his Grand-fathers Brothers wife) be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by good and ſound deduction of Conſequence within the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> not particularly expreſſed? For, I think it evident, it is not among thoſe that are expreſs'd, neither in the <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latin Tranſlations,</hi> nor in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> names of Kindred, where my <hi>Fathers Coſen German</hi> hath the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of my <hi>Uncle;</hi> nor holpen by the <hi>gloſs</hi> of being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the <hi>Twentieth of Leviticus,</hi> though not in the <hi>Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word <hi>Uncle</hi> is an <hi>equivocal</hi> expreſſion, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places ſignifies ſeveral Relations; as in the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Grand-fathers Coſen German</hi> is accounted an <hi>Uncle</hi> to the <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Fathers <hi>Brother</hi> hath in <hi>Latin</hi> a ſpecifique term of Relation to the Son or Daughter, <hi>viz. Patruus.</hi>

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:99478:130"/>3. In <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius's</hi> Tranſlation, done with regard to the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and the <hi>Original,</hi> the <hi>Twentieth of Leviticus, verſe the twentieth,</hi> is rendred <hi>Quiſquis cubaverit cum Amita ſua nuditatem patrui ſui retexit,</hi> where expreſly, inſtead of, and <hi>uncovered his Uncles ſhame,</hi> it is <hi>uncover'd his Uncle, his Fathers Brothers ſhame,</hi> which makes it the ſame with the <hi>Eighteenth of Leviticus, verſe the fourteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore firſt agree, That <hi>marriage</hi> with the <hi>Grand-mother, Great-grand-mother,</hi> and with the <hi>Great-grand-father,</hi> and ſo upwards, without limit; is, though not expreſſed, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>prohibited</hi> in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> as marriage with the <hi>Father, Mother,</hi> or <hi>Grand-father,</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter:</hi> So as in the right Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Line of <hi>Generation</hi> there can be no lawful marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> are the <hi>immediate</hi> natural Cauſes of the being of their Children, and the <hi>Grand-father</hi> and <hi>Grand-mother</hi> are natural <hi>mediate</hi> cauſes of their being, and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the right aſcending Line interminately; for a man could no more be what he is, without his <hi>Grand-father</hi> and <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> and ſo upwards, than without his <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Therefore they are really <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>neceſſary mediate</hi> cauſes of bringing the Children to have being, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is due of <hi>reverence</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment</hi> for his being, from the Child to Father or Mother, is likewiſe due to thoſe other <hi>Relations</hi> in the Aſcending right Line.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Uncle, quatenus</hi> Vncle, &amp;c. doth no more contribute to the natural being of the Nephew or Neece, than as if he had not at all been.</p>
                  <p>The marriage of the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter</hi> with <hi>Grand-mother</hi> or <hi>Grand-father,</hi> and ſo with any <hi>Anceſtor, Male</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> in the right Aſcending Line, is, after Laws determining the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reverence due to Parents, <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For there is unnaturalneſs in Civil things, when conſtituted, ſometimes;</p>
                  <p>Though there be no <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> originally in nature, but only <hi>parity,</hi> yet after Laws have conſtituted thoſe Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> cannot at the ſame time be both <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> there is a repugnancy in the nature of thoſe two Offices, to be conſiſtent in the ſame perſons at once.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:99478:130"/>
                  <p>A <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> cannot be Servant to their Son or Daughter; for under the <hi>relation</hi> of <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother,</hi> the Son is to obey them, but in that of <hi>Servant,</hi> they to obey him, which is <hi>repugnant,</hi> and againſt the nature of thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vnder the <hi>Law</hi> it was not forbidden a man to Curſe his <hi>Servant,</hi> but Death to Curſe his <hi>Father or Mother.</hi> A man might <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſe</hi> his Servant <hi>qua</hi> ſuch, but <hi>penal</hi> alike to chaſtiſe his <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> in this ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>The marriage of the Son with his Mother, or the Daughter with her Father, are unnatural.</p>
                  <p>For as a Husband to her, the Son is both to command and correct the <hi>Mother</hi> as his wife, but as a Son, to be commanded, and endure her <hi>Correction</hi> as Mother.</p>
                  <p>So between the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Daughter,</hi> there is a <hi>Reverence</hi> from the Daughter to the Father, inconſiſtent with the parity between <hi>man</hi> and <hi>wife;</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> give often a power over the daughter, which they forbid over the wife.</p>
                  <p>And the reverence and obedience from the <hi>Grand-child</hi> to the <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> in what degree ſoever, is the ſame as to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the ſame conſequences follow.</p>
                  <p>For if the <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> have power <hi>abſolute,</hi> or <hi>in tantum,</hi> over the Son or Daughter, to create reverence to them; the ſame hath the <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> or <hi>Grand-father,</hi> and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>For if <hi>B.</hi> the Father have abſolute or qualified power over <hi>A.</hi> the Son, and <hi>C.</hi> the <hi>Grand-father</hi> hath the ſame over <hi>B.</hi> the Father, then hath <hi>C.</hi> the Grand-father the ſame over <hi>A.</hi> the Son, not <hi>immediately</hi> but <hi>mediately</hi> by the Father.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe the Caſe put in <hi>Platt's</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Com.</hi> is moſt oppoſite. A <hi>woman Guardian</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi> marries her Priſoner in Execution, he is immediately out of Execution, for the <hi>Husband</hi> cannot be <hi>Priſoner</hi> to his <hi>Wife,</hi> it being <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> that ſhe, as <hi>Jaylor,</hi> ſhould have the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of him, and he, as <hi>Husband,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of her.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe alſo, it is remarkable what that great <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>Lawyer, Hugo Grotius</hi> hath; <hi>Eximo ab hac generalitate matrimonium parentum cujuſcunque gradus cum liberis quae quo minus licita ſint ratio, ni fallor, ſatis apparet.</hi>

                     <hi>Nam nec maritus qui ſuperior eſt lege matrimonii eam reverentiam praeſtare poteſt matri quam natura exigit, nec patri filia, quia quanquam inferior eſt in matrimonio; ipſum tamen matrimonium talem inducit ſocietatem, quae illius neceſſitudinis reverentiam excludat.</hi>

                  <p>But as to other Relations, the ſame <hi>Author,</hi> in the ſame place,</p>

                     <hi>De Conjugiis eorum qui ſanguine aut affinitate junguntur ſatis gravis eſt quaeſtio, &amp; non raro magnis motibus agitata; nam cauſas certas, ac naturales cur talia conjugia, ita ut legibus aut moribus vetantur illicita ſint aſſignare qui voluerit, experiendo diſcet quam id ſit difficile, imo praeſtari non poſſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I add only, That as the <hi>mutual</hi> duties of <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> conſiſt not with their marrying one another; ſo the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi> between them will have a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>monſtrous</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of <hi>Relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Son or Daughter, born of the Mother, and begot by the Son, as born of the mother, will be a <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Siſter</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> but as begot by him, will be a <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Iſſue <hi>procreate</hi> upon the <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> as born of the <hi>Grand-mother,</hi> will be <hi>Uncles or Aunts</hi> to the Father, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by the Son, they will be Sons or Daughters to him, and this in the firſt degrees of <hi>Kindred.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides, by the <hi>Laws of England</hi> Children inherit their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors without limit in the <hi>right aſcending Line,</hi> and are not inherited by them.

                  <p>In the <hi>Civil Law</hi> the <hi>Agnati, viz.</hi> the Father, or Grand-fathers Brother, are <hi>loco parentum;</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> borrow it thence, but that is becauſe they were <hi>Legitimi Tutores,</hi> or <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> to their Nephews; with us the <hi>Lord,</hi> of whom the <hi>Land</hi> is held, is <hi>Guardian,</hi> or the next of <hi>Kin</hi> to whom the <hi>Land</hi> cannot deſcend, and by the ſame reaſon they ſhould be <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co parentum.</hi>

                  <p>In a <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Convocation</hi> holden in <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1603. of the <hi>Province of Canterbury,</hi> by the Kings Writ, and with Licence under the Great Seal to conſent and agree of ſuch <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtick</hi> as they ſhould think fit.</p>
                  <p>Several <hi>Canons</hi> were concluded, and after ratified under the Great Seal, as they ought to be; among which the <hi>Ninety ninth Canon</hi> is this:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>No perſon ſhall marry within the Degrees prohibited by Gods Law, and expreſſed in a Table ſet forth by Authority,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Canons 1 Jac. 1603. Can. 99.</note> 
                     <hi>in the year of our Lord,</hi> 1563. <hi>and all marriages ſo made and contracted, ſhall be adjudg'd inceſtuous and unlawful: And the aforeſaid Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall be in every Church publickly ſet up and fixed, at the charge of the Pariſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Table was firſt publiſht in Arch-biſhop <hi>Parker's</hi> time, in 1563.

                  <p>And this marriage is not prohibited in that <hi>Table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an Objection, That by the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Civil Law</hi> this Degree of Marriage in queſtion is prohibited.</p>
                  <p>It is true; but by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 38. All <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> by the <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Civil Law, quatenus Canon</hi> or <hi>Civil Law,</hi> are wholly excluded, and unleſs the marriage be prohibited by the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> it is made lawful.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe the <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Civil Law</hi> were to be taken as a meaſure in the ſubject of marriage of what were lawful.</p>
                  <p>With the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> of what time would you begin, for it varies as the <hi>Laws Civil</hi> of any Nation do, in <hi>ſucceſſive Ages.</hi> Before the <hi>Council of Lateran,</hi> it was another Law than ſince, for marriages before were forbid to the <hi>Seventh Degree</hi> from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Germans incluſively, ſince to the <hi>Fourth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every Council</hi> varied ſomewhat in the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and <hi>every Pope</hi> from the former, and often from himſelf, as every new <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> varies the Law of <hi>England,</hi> more or leſs; and that which always changeth can be no meaſure of <hi>Rectitude,</hi> unleſs confin'd to what was the Law in a certain time, and then no reaſon will make that a better meaſure than what was the Law in a certain other time: As the Law of <hi>England</hi> is not a righter Law of <hi>England</hi> in one Kings Reign, than in another, yet much differing.</p>

                  <p>For that is not an <hi>Averment,</hi> That the Marriage was out of the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> to the <hi>Temporal Judges;</hi> for they can take no <hi>Iſſue,</hi> nor try what Plea was before the <hi>Spiritual Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then upon this pleading, it no way appears that the <hi>Libel</hi> was for marrying againſt the <hi>Law of God;</hi> and if it were not, then the <hi>Spiritual Gourt</hi> had no Conizance, though it were againſt the <hi>Canons</hi> which the <hi>Act of 32. had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Prohibition</hi> might well be awarded, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe the <hi>Libel</hi> was, That the marriage was Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous.</p>
                  <p>Next, a <hi>Conſultation</hi> might be granted, unleſs cauſe were ſhew'd, for it was no otherwiſe. Becauſe the <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> was not, That the <hi>marriage</hi> was out of the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> but that the perſons married were <hi>extra leges Leviticales,</hi> which was as if they had ſaid, They were not under the <hi>Jewiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then a <hi>Conſultation</hi> might be granted upon this <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as upon that of <hi>Mann's</hi> Caſe, becauſe the Plaintiff did not <hi>averr the marriage to be extra gradus Leviticus,</hi> and ground his <hi>Prohibition</hi> thereupon.</p>
                  <p>As thoſe <hi>two Prohibitions</hi> were for marrying the <hi>Wives</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters daughter, that is, the Wives Neece by the Siſter. So there is a Caſe in the Lord <hi>Hobbard,</hi>

                  <p>It is agreed generally for Law,<note place="margin">Cok. Litt. f. 122. a.</note> That a Preſcription to have <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem Communiam</hi> incertain Land, doth not exclude the Owner of the Soyl to have Paſture or Eſtovers.</p>
                  <p>But by that <hi>Book</hi> a man may preſcribe to have <hi>Solam veſturam terrae</hi> from a certain day, to a certain day in the year, and ſo to have <hi>Solam paſturam terrae.</hi> And ſo are the Books of 15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>pl.</hi> 51. and of <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>pl.</hi> 55. <hi>in Fitz-herbert, Title Preſcription,</hi> but they go no further, nor determine what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate he hath who claims <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem paſturam</hi> to him and his Heirs, excluding the Lord wholly from any Paſture, Hay, or Corn.</p>
                  <p>In granting or preſcribing to have <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniam,</hi> why the Lord is not excluded, is not clear by that <hi>Book,</hi> or any other. For,</p>
                  <p>There are two notions or ſenſes of the word <hi>Communia,</hi> the one, as it ſignifies that Intereſt in the Common which one Commoner hath againſt another, not to have the Common ſurcharg'd. And is that Intereſt,<note place="margin">Fitz. Na. Br. de Admenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturae, f. 125. a.</note> to which the <hi>Writ De Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuratione paſturae</hi> relates, which only lies for Commoner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Commoner, and not for a Commoner againſt the Lord, or for the Lord againſt a Commoner, as is clear by <hi>Fitz-herbert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in this ſenſe there may be <hi>Sola &amp; ſeparalis Communia,</hi> for only one may have right of Common, and no more, either by Grant or Preſcription. So in this ſenſe one part of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of a <hi>Mannor</hi> may have the ſole right of Commoning in a certain place, excluding the other part of the Tenants,<note place="margin">Foyſton's C. 4. Rep.</note> and may claim there <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem Communiam à caeteris Tenentibus Manerii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:99478:137"/>
                  <p>The other notion of <hi>Communia</hi> is, when one or more hath right to Paſture with the Owner of the Soyl; and in this ſenſe it is impoſſible for a man to have <hi>ſolam &amp; ſeparalem Communiam,</hi> for one cannot have that alone which is to be had with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor do that alone which is to be done with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>So as a man may have <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem Communiam</hi> in that ſenſe, that none is to be a <hi>Commoner</hi> but himſelf, but not in that ſenſe that none elſe ſhould depaſture the Land but he; for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munia</hi> cannot ſignifie an abſolute ſeveral.</p>
                  <p>As 'tis a Contradiction, that a Common, which is to more than one, can be a ſeveral, and belong but to one.</p>
                  <p>So it is an <hi>equal Contradiction,</hi> That what in its nature is to be the right of one only, can be Common, and the right of more than one.</p>
                  <p>Others cannot have what is only to be had by me, more than I can have only what is to be had by others with me.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Sola &amp; ſeparalis Paſtura</hi> may be enjoyed by one, or by many jointly, and by way of Survivor, but not by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by different Titles, as belonging to ſeveral Free-holds, for <hi>Sola &amp; ſeparalis paſtura</hi> can be, but <hi>Soli &amp; ſeparatim.</hi>

                  <p>A man cannot have an <hi>Aſſiſe of Common</hi> in his own Soyl, nor an <hi>Admenſuratio paſturae,</hi> and a Common being a thing that lies in grant, he cannot grant it to himſelf, and no other can grant it in his Soyl to him.</p>
                  <p>So as I conclude, one or more may have <hi>Solam &amp; ſeparalem Communiam</hi> from other Commoners, but not from the Lord, who is no Commoner.</p>
                  <p>I cannot diſcern the uſe of this kind of Preſcription for the Tenants; for if it be to hinder the Lord from approving the Common, I think they are miſtaken.</p>

                  <p>To preſcribe to have in ſuch a part of the Lord's Lands <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniam</hi> for their Cattel, excludes not the Lord.</p>

               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:99478:140"/>
               <p>In a Will Eſtates are often given by <hi>implication.</hi> But I ſhall take this difference concerning Eſtates that paſs by <hi>implication,</hi> though it be by <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Eſtate given by <hi>implication</hi> of a <hi>Will,</hi> if it be to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting of the Heir at Law, is not good, if ſuch <hi>implication</hi> be only <hi>conſtructive</hi> and <hi>poſſible,</hi> but not a neceſſary <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mean by a <hi>poſſible implication,</hi> when it may be intended that the Teſtator did purpoſe, and had an intention to deviſe his Land to <hi>A.</hi> but it may alſo be as reaſonably intended, that he had no ſuch purpoſe or intention to deviſe it to <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I call that a deviſe by <hi>neceſſary implication</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> when <hi>A.</hi> muſt have the thing devis'd, or none elſe can have it.</p>
               <p>And therefore if the <hi>implication</hi> be only <hi>poſſible,</hi> and not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> the Teſtators intent ought not to be conſtrued to diſinherit the Heir, in thwarting the Diſpoſe which the Law makes of the Land, leaving it to <hi>deſcend,</hi> where the intention of the Teſtator is not apparently, and not ambiguouſly to the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It grew a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whether this were an Intayl to <hi>Henry</hi> of the <hi>South-fields,</hi> or only of the Bargains and Grants which the Teſtator had from <hi>Welb,</hi> which was a very meaſuring Caſe; and in determining this Caſe</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Four Judges</hi> agreed, <hi>That the words of a Will, which ſhall diſinherit the Heir at Common Law, muſt have a clear and apparent intent, and not be ambiguous, or any way doubtful,</hi> (So are the very words of the Book) and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in that Caſe, That only the <hi>Bargains</hi> and <hi>Grants</hi> had from <hi>Welb</hi> were intayl'd to the youngeſt Son, and that he had only an Eſtate for life in the Paſtures in the <hi>South-fields.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> In the third place I ſhall ſhew, That being ſo as to the Caſe in queſtion, it is not material whether the deviſe by way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> to the Nephew, be void or not.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> In the fourth place, <hi>ex abundante,</hi> and to make the Will of the Teſtator not ineffectual in that part of the Will, I ſhall ſhew, That the <hi>Nephew</hi> hath not the Land devis'd to him, when the ſon and the two daughters dye without Iſſue of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive bodies, by way of <hi>Remainder,</hi> which cannot be but by way of <hi>Executory deviſe,</hi> which well may be.</p>

               <p>To manifeſt the difference taken between an <hi>implication</hi> in a Will that is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>implication</hi> that is only <hi>poſſible,</hi> the firſt Caſe I ſhall cite is that known Caſe <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> which I ſhall exactly put as it is in the Book at large.<note place="margin">13 H. 7. f. 17. Br. Deviſe pl. 52.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A man devis'd his Goods to his wife, and that after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of his wife, his ſon and heir ſhall have the Houſe where his Goods are: The ſon ſhall not have the Houſe during the wives life; for though it be, not expreſly devis'd to the wife, yet his intent appears, the ſon ſhall not have it during her life; and therefore it is a good deviſe to the wife for life, by implication, and the Deviſors intent, <hi>Quod omnes Juſtitiarii conceſſerunt.</hi> Here I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> That this was a deviſe of the Houſe to the wife by <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry implication;</hi> for it appears by the Will that the Teſtators ſon and heir was not to have it until after the death of the wife, and then it muſt either be devis'd to the wife for life by <hi>neceſſary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> or none was to have it during the wives life, which could not be.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> I obſerve upon this Caſe, That though the Goods were by particular deviſe given to the wife, and expreſly, that was no hindrance to the wives having the Houſe devis'd to her, alſo by her husband by <hi>implication</hi> neceſſary: which I the rather note, becauſe men of great name have conceiv'd, <hi>That where, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee takes any thing by expreſs deviſe of the Teſtator, ſuch devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee ſhall not have any other thing by that Will devis'd, only by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>

               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:99478:141"/>
               <p>Which difference, if it were according to <hi>Law,</hi> it makes clearly againſt the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Leſſor</hi> being one of the Daughters of the Teſtator, had devis'd to her expreſly for a Portion, and therefore ſhe ſhould not have any Eſtate in the Land by the ſame Will, by a <hi>Deviſe</hi> by Implication, as is pretended.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that is a vain difference that hath been taken by many, as I ſhall anon evince, and therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon any <hi>Aid</hi> from it to my concluſion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> I note that this Deviſe being before the <hi>Statute of 32 H. 8.</hi> of <hi>Wills,</hi> the Houſe devis'd muſt be conceiv'd deviſable by <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed further, I muſt take notice that <hi>Brook,</hi> in abridging the Caſe of <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> in the ſame <hi>numero,</hi> ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deviſe Br. n. 52.</note>It was agreed, <hi>tempore H. 8. per omnes,</hi> That if a man will that <hi>J.

I note firſt, That this Caſe is imperfectly put in <hi>Brook,</hi> for it mentions a deviſe of the Land in <hi>Dale</hi> to <hi>J.

And this Caſe ſeems to be only a memory of another Caſe,<note place="margin">Br.

               <p>That if a man will that <hi>J.

               <p>But by this Caſe in <hi>Br. Title Deviſe n. 48. &amp; 52.</hi> there is no excluding of the Heir, and yet it is ſaid the wife ſhall have the Land during her life by implication, which is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary implication, as in the Caſe of <hi>13 H. 7.</hi> but only a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible implication, and ſeems to croſs that difference I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before.</p>

               <p>But this Caſe of <hi>Br.</hi> hath many times been denied to be Law, and ſeveral Iudgments have been given againſt it. I ſhall give you ſome of them, to juſtifie the difference I have taken, exactly as I ſhall preſs the Caſes.</p>

               <p>It was reſolved by all the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> That the laſt deviſe ſhould not take effect for any part of the <hi>Mannor,</hi> but after the wives death; but yet the wife ſhould not have the whole <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> by <hi>implication</hi> during her life, but ſhould have only the demeſnes for her life, and the <hi>Rent</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> for <hi>Fifteen years,</hi> and that after the <hi>Fifteen years</hi> ended the Heir ſhould have the <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> as long as the wife liv'd: Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no neceſſary Implication that the wife ſhould have all the Mannor during her life, with an excluſion of the Heir; ſhe had no more than was explicity given her by the Will, <hi>viz.</hi> the Demeſnes for life, and the Rents and Services for <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years;</hi> but after the <hi>Fifteen years</hi> the Heir had the <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> for it could be no more at moſt but a poſſible <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> that the wife ſhould have the whole <hi>Mannor,</hi> during her life.</p>
               <p>But with a ſmall variance of this Caſe if the demeſnes had been devis'd to the wife for life, and the <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> for <hi>Fifteen years,</hi> and the whole <hi>Mannor</hi> after the wives life to <hi>J.

               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion in that Caſe was, Whether the wife ſhould have the Land not leaſed by implication for her life, becauſe it was clear, the younger Son was to have no part, until the death of the wife. And the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> at firſt, grounding himſelf upon that Caſe in <hi>Brook</hi> (as it ſeems) of <hi>29 H. 8.</hi> twice by <hi>Brook</hi> remembred in his Title <hi>Deviſe n. 28.</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>n. 52.</hi> was of opinion, That the wife ſhould have the Land not leaſed by implication: But <hi>Mead</hi> was of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that it was expreſly devis'd, That the wife ſhould have the Land leas'd; and therefore no more ſhould be intended to be given her, but the Heir ſhould have the Land not in leaſe, during the wives life. To which <hi>Anderſon, mutata opinione,</hi> agreed. Hence perhaps many have collected, That a perſon ſhall not take Land by <hi>Implication</hi> of a Will, if he takes ſome other Land expreſly by the ſame Will; but that is no warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table difference.</p>
               <p>For vary this Caſe but a little, as the former caſe was vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Land in leaſe was devis'd to the wife for life, and after the death of the wife, all the Deviſors land was devis'd to the youngeſt Son, as this Caſe was; and that after the death of the wife, and the youngeſt ſon, the Deviſors Heir ſhould have the Land both leas'd, and not leas'd: it had been clear that the Heir (exactly according to the Caſe of <hi>13 H. 7.</hi>) ſhould have been excluded from all the Land leas'd, and not leas'd, until after the death of the wife and the younger ſon. And therefore in ſuch caſe the wife, by neceſſary implication, ſhould have had the Land not leas'd, as ſhe had the Land leas'd by expreſs deviſe, and that notwithſtanding ſhe had the leas'd Land by expreſs deviſe, for elſe none could have the Land not leas'd during the wives life.</p>

               <p>The deviſe to the Nephew, <hi>William Roſe,</hi> be void or not; and if not void, how and when he ſhall take by the deviſe, which may come in queſtion perhaps hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:99478:143"/>
               <p>But to that point <hi>ex abundante,</hi> and to make the Will not ineffectual in that point of the deviſe to the Nephew, if no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for lives, or other Eſtate, be created by this Will by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to the Son and Daughters, it follows, That the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew</hi> can take nothing by way of <hi>Remainder,</hi> for the <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> muſt depend upon ſome particular Eſtate, and be created the ſame time with the <hi>particular Eſtate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cok. Litt. f. 49. a.</note> The <hi>Remainder</hi> is the reſidue of an Eſtate in Land depending upon a particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and created together with the ſame, and the Will crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no particular Eſtate, the conſequent muſt be, That the Land was left to deſcend in Fee-ſimple to the heir at law, without creating either particular Eſtate or <hi>Remainder</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> hath a Caſe,<note place="margin">Cok. Litt. f. 18. a.</note> but <hi>quotes</hi> no Authority for it; If <hi>Land</hi> be given to <hi>H.</hi> and his heirs, as long as <hi>B.</hi> hath heirs of his body, the <hi>Remainder</hi> over in Fee, the <hi>Remainder</hi> is void, being a <hi>Remainder</hi> after a <hi>Fee-ſimple,</hi> though that <hi>Fee-ſimple</hi> determines when no heirs are left of the body of <hi>B.</hi> whether that caſe be law or not, I ſhall not now diſcuſs; in regard that when ſuch a baſe Fee determines for want of Iſſue of the body of <hi>B.</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> returns to the Grantor and his heirs, as a kind of <hi>Reverſion,</hi> and if there can be a <hi>Reverſion</hi> of ſuch Eſtate, I know not why a <hi>Remainder</hi> may not be granted of it, but for the former reaſon, this can be no <hi>Remainder,</hi> becauſe no particular Eſtate is upon which it depends; and if the Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> Caſe be law, it is the ſtronger,<note place="margin">Cok. Litt. f. 18. a. Sect. 11.</note> that no <hi>Remainder</hi> is in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>But without queſtion, a <hi>Remainder</hi> cannot depend upon an abſolute Fee-ſimple by neceſſary reaſon; For when all a man hath of Eſtate, or any thing elſe, is given, or gone away, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains but an abſolute <hi>Fee-ſimple,</hi> being given or gone out of a man, that being all, no other or further Eſtate can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be given or diſpos'd, and therefore no <hi>Remainder</hi> can be of a <hi>pure Fee-ſimple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe is the Caſe of <hi>Hearne and Allen</hi> in this <hi>Court.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Car. 1. Cr. f. 57.</note> 
                  <hi>Richard Keen</hi> ſeis'd of a <hi>Meſſuage</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> in <hi>Cheping-Norton,</hi> having Iſſue <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son, and <hi>Anne</hi> a Daughter by the ſame <hi>Venter,</hi> devis'd his <hi>Land</hi> to <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son, and his heirs for ever; and for want of heirs of <hi>Thomas,</hi> to <hi>Anne</hi> and her heirs, and died.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:99478:144"/>
               <p>It became a Queſtion, Whether <hi>Thomas</hi> had an Eſtate in Fee or in Tayl by this Will, for he could not dye without heir if his Siſter outlived him, who was to take according to the intent of the Deviſor? Two <hi>Judges</hi> held it (and with reaſon) to be an Eſtate tayl in <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Remainder to the <hi>Daughter,</hi> who might be his heir, ſhew'd, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to him and his heirs could be intended only to be to him and the heirs of his body; But three other Judges held it to be a deviſe in Fee, but all agreed, if the <hi>Remainder</hi> had been to a Stranger it had been void, for then <hi>Thomas</hi> (which is only to my purpoſe) had had an abſolute Eſtate in Fee, after which there could be no <hi>Remainder,</hi> which is undoubted law.</p>
               <p>The Caſe out of <hi>Coke's Littleton,</hi> and this Caſe, are the ſame to this purpoſe, That a <hi>Remainder</hi> cannot depend upon a Fee-ſimple; yet in another reſpect they much differ: For in this laſt Caſe, after an Eſtate in Fee devis'd to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and if he died without heir, the <hi>Remainder</hi> to a Stranger or <hi>Siſter</hi> of the half blood, not only the <hi>Remainder</hi> was void as a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but no future deviſe could have been made of the land by the Deviſor; for if <hi>Thomas</hi> died without heir the land eſcheated, and the Lords Title would precede any future deviſe.</p>
               <p>But in that Caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> which he puts by way of Grant, if it be put by way of deviſe, That if land be deviſed to <hi>H.</hi> and his heirs as long as <hi>B.</hi> hath heirs of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the <hi>Remainder</hi> over, ſuch later deviſe will be good, though not as a <hi>Remainder,</hi> yet as an <hi>Executory deviſe,</hi> becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remain'd to be devis'd when the Eſtate in Fee determin'd upon <hi>B.</hi> his having no Iſſue of his Body.</p>
               <p>And as an <hi>Executory Deviſe,</hi> and not as a <hi>Remainder,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Nephew ſhall well take in the preſent Caſe. And the intention of the Teſtator, by his Will, will run as if he had ſaid, <hi>I leave my Land to deſcend to my Son and his Heirs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Common Law, until he, and both my Daughters, ſhall happen to dye without Iſſue; And then I deviſe my Land to my Nephew <hi>William Roſe,</hi> and his Heirs. Or as if he had ſaid, my Son ſhall have all my Land, To have and to hold, to him and his Heirs, in Fee-ſimple, as long as any Heirs of the bodies of <hi>A.B.</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> ſhall be living, and for want of ſuch Heirs, I deviſe my Land to my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>William Roſe</hi> and his Heirs.</hi> The Nephew ſhall take as by a future and <hi>Executory Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:99478:144"/>
               <p>And there is no difference, whether ſuch deviſe be <hi>limited</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the contingent of three Strangers dying without Heirs of their bodies, or upon the contingent of three of the Deviſors own Children, dying without Heirs of their Bodies; for if a future deviſe may be upon any contingent, after a Fee-ſimple, it may as well be upon any other contingent, if it appear by the Will the Teſtator intended his Son and Heir ſhould have his Land in Fee-ſimple.</p>
               <p>This way of Executory deviſe after a Fee-ſimple of any nature, was in former Ages unknown, as appears by a Caſe in the Lord <hi>Dyer, 29 H. 8. f. 33.</hi> concerning a Deviſe to the <hi>Prior of St. Bartholomew in Weſt-Smithfield,</hi> by the clear Opinion of <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Fitz herbert,</hi> the greateſt Lawyers of the Age.</p>
               <p>But now nothing more ordinary. The Caſes are for the moſt part remembred in <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> Caſe, that is, <hi>Dyer f. 124. Ed. Clatch his Caſe, f. 330. b. &amp; 354. Wellock &amp; Hamonds Caſe</hi> cited in <hi>Boraſtons Caſe, 3. Rep. Fulmerſton &amp; Stewards Caſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance two Caſes. The firſt is <hi>Haynſworths and Prettyes</hi> Caſe, Where a man ſeis'd of <hi>Land</hi> in <hi>Soccage,</hi> having Iſſue two Sons and a Daughter, devis'd to his youngeſt Son and Daughter <hi>Twenty pounds</hi> apiece, to be paid by his eldeſt Son, and devis'd his Lands to his eldeſt Son and his Heirs, upon Condition if he paid not thoſe Legacies, that his Land ſhould be to his ſecond Son and Daughter, and their Heirs. The eldeſt Son fail'd of payment. After Argument upon a Special Verdict, It was reſolv'd by the Court clearly, That the ſecond Son and Daughter ſhould have the Land.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> For that the deviſe to his Son and his Heir in Fee,<note place="margin">Hill. 41. El. Cr. 833. a.</note> being no other then what the Law gave him was void.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That it was a future deviſe to the ſecond Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon the contingent of the eldeſt Sons default of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> That it was no more in effect than if he had devis'd, That if his eldeſt Son did not pay all Legacies, that his land ſhould be to the Legatories, and there was no doubt in that Caſe, but the land, in default of payment, ſhould veſt in them.</p>
               <p>Which Caſe, in the reaſon of law, differs not from the preſent Caſe, where the land is devis'd by deviſe <hi>future</hi> and <hi>executory</hi> to the Nephew, upon a contingent to happen by the Teſtators Son and Daughters having no iſſue.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:99478:145"/>

                  <note place="margin">18 Jac. Pell &amp; Browns C. Cro. f. 590.</note>The ſecond Caſe is that of <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> the Father being ſeis'd of certain land, having Iſſue <hi>William</hi> his eldeſt Son, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> devis'd the land to <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Heirs for ever; and if <hi>Thomas</hi> died without Iſſue, living <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> then <hi>William</hi> ſhould have the lands to him, his Heirs and Aſſigns.</p>
               <p n="1">

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That <hi>William</hi> by way of <hi>Executory deviſe,</hi> had an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple in poſſibility, if <hi>Thomas</hi> died without Iſſue before him.</p>
               <p>And it being once clear, That the Eſtate of <hi>Thomas</hi> was a Fee-ſimple, determinable upon a contingent, and not an Eſtate tayl, and ſo in the preſent caſe it being clear'd, that <hi>George,</hi> the Teſtators Son, had the land deſcended to him in Fee from the Teſtator, and took no Eſtate tayl expreſly, or by implication from the Will, it will not be material whether the <hi>Contingent</hi> which ſhall determine that Fee-ſimple proceeds from the perſon which hath ſuch determinable Fee, or from another, or partly from him, and partly from another, as in <hi>Haynſworth's</hi> Caſe, the Son determined his Fee-ſimple by not paying the <hi>Legacies;</hi> in <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Brown's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Thomas</hi> his Fee-ſimple determined by his dying without Iſſue, living <hi>William,</hi> the Fee-ſimple veſted in <hi>George</hi> the Son by deſcent, determines when he and his two Siſters dye without Iſſue; and upon ſuch determination in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of theſe Caſes, the future and executory deviſe muſt take effect.</p>
               <p>But the great Objection is, That if this ſhould be an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory deviſe to the <hi>Nephew,</hi> upon the contingent of <hi>George</hi> the Son, and both his Siſters dying without Iſſue. It will be dangerous to introduce a new way of <hi>perpetuity;</hi> for if a man have ſeveral Children, and ſhall permit his Eſtate to deſcend, or by his Will deviſe it to his Heir, ſo as he may therein have an unqueſtionable Fee-ſimple (which is the ſame with permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to deſcend) he may then deviſe it futurely, when all his Children ſhall dye without Iſſue of their bodies to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his Heirs, as long as <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> ſtrangers, ſhall have any Heirs of their bodies living, and then to a third perſon by like future deviſe: For if he ſhould deviſe it futurely to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his <hi>Heirs,</hi> as long as <hi>J. S.</hi> had any Heirs of his body, it were a clear Eſtate tayl in <hi>J.

               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:99478:145"/>
               <p>This Objection was in ſome meaſure made by <hi>Doderidge</hi> in <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> Caſe, and the Iudges ſaid there was no danger,<note place="margin">Vid. Stiles Rep. Gay &amp; Gaps Caſe, 258, 275.</note> becauſe the Eſtate in Fee of <hi>Thomas</hi> did not determine by his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Heir of his body generally, but by dying without Iſſue, living <hi>William;</hi> for if the land had been given to <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Heirs for ever, and if he died without Heirs of his body, then to <hi>William</hi> and his Heirs, <hi>Thomas</hi> his Eſtate had been judg'd an Eſtate tayl with the <hi>Remainder</hi> to <hi>William,</hi> and not a Fee, upon which no future or executory deviſe can be. So was it adjudg'd in <hi>Foy and Hinds Caſe 22 Jac. Cr. f. 695. &amp; 6.</hi> and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>37 Aſſ. p. 18. 5.

               </p>
               <p>But in <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Browns Caſe,</hi> the Iudges ſaid it was more dangerous to deſtroy future deviſes, than to admit of ſuch <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuities</hi> as could follow from them any way by determinable Fee-ſimples, which is true; for a Fee ſimple, determinable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a contingent, is a Fee-ſimple to all intents, but not ſo dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as abſolute Fee-ſimples. And all Fee-ſimples are unequally durable, for one will eſcheat ſooner than another by the failer of Heirs. An Eſtate of Fee-ſimple will determine in a <hi>Baſtard</hi> with his life, if he want Iſſue. An Eſtate to a man and his Heirs as long as <hi>John Stiles</hi> hath any Heir, which is no abſolute Fee-ſimple, is doubtleſs as durable as the Eſtate in Fee which <hi>John Stiles</hi> hath to him and his Heirs, which is an abſolute Fee-ſimple. Nor do I know any Law ſimply againſt a <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> but againſt Intails of <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> for every Fee-ſimple is a <hi>perpetuity,</hi> but in the <hi>accident</hi> of <hi>Alienation,</hi> and <hi>Alienation</hi> is an incident to a Fee-ſimple determinable upon a contingent, as to any more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or more perdurable Fee-ſimple.</p>

                  <p n="2">

               <p>In the Argument upon <hi>Harriſons Caſe,</hi> I ſaid, and ſtill ſay, That if granting <hi>Prohibitions</hi> to the Spiritual Courts in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Matrimony, were <hi>res integra</hi> now, I ſaw no reaſon why we ſhould grant them in any Caſe. The matter being wholly of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Conizance,</hi> my Reaſons were and are</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe in all times ſome marriages were lawful, and others prohibited by <hi>Divine and Eccleſiaſtick Laws</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> yet the Temporal Courts could not prohibit the impeaching of any marriage, how lawful ſoever, nor take notice of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> anciently, all marriages not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, had been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lawful, the Temporal Courts thereby had no power to prohibit the <hi>queſtioning</hi> of any marriage more than before, for it had ſaid no more than what the Law was, and did ſay before ſuch Act.</p>
               <p>So had it been enacted, That all marriages ſhould be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> not prohibited by the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> the Church had retain'd the judging which were againſt the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> as they did when the unlawfulneſs was not confin'd only to the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Queſtion now concerning what are the <hi>Levitical Degrees?</hi> (whereof we aſſume the <hi>Conizance</hi>) is but the ſame as the queſtion would be concerning what marriages were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the <hi>Eighteenth of Leviticus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though ſuch <hi>Acts of Parliaments</hi> had been, yet they had given no new Iurisdiction or Conizance in matrimonial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>Temporal Courts,</hi> but had been only directory to the <hi>Courts</hi> which had the Conizance; and if any Iudgment had been given amiſs in them, it was to be rectified by appeal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Statutes, or by Commiſſions of Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>But I then ſaid, That ſince <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> many Prohibitions have been granted to the Spiritual Courts concerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages without the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> in ſeveral Ages. And that therefore in a Caſe concerning the Extent of the <hi>Spiritual and Temporal Juriſdiction,</hi> and after ſo many <hi>Parliaments</hi> wherein no complaint hath been made, or certainly no redreſs given, it cannot be expected we ſhould, againſt ſo many judicial Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, take upon us to alter the Law ſo long practiz'd, ſpecially after <hi>Hariſons</hi> Caſe, in which all the Iudges were adviſed with.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:99478:161"/>
               <p>Therefore taking it for granted, That the Temporal Courts can prohibit the impeaching of marriages without the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> (for before no Prohibition was ever granted in that kind: The Queſtion is,</p>
               <p>Whether the marriage of the Husband with his Wives Siſter, after the Wives death, be ſuch a marriage as by the Act of <hi>32.</hi> the <hi>Temporal Courts</hi> may prohibit the impeaching or drawing it into queſtion in the <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> in order to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce or ſeparation of the parties? And I conceive they cannot for theſe Reaſons,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> I affirm this marriage to be expreſly prohibited within the <hi>Eighteenth of Leviticus,</hi> and then it muſt be within the <hi>Levitical Degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If it were not ſo prohibited, yet it is not a marriage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> but within them, and therefore no <hi>Prohibition</hi> will lye for impeaching it; for marriages not to be impeached muſt be without the <hi>Degrees,</hi> and for that ſome mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages within the Degrees may be lawful.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> That if this marriage be without the <hi>Levitical Degrees,</hi> yet it is a marriage prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and therefore to be impeached, notwithſtanding the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>32.</hi> whoſe words are, <hi>No marriage (Gods Law excepted) ſhall be impeached without the Levitical Degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a Law is given to any people, it is neceſſary that it be conceiv'd and publiſh'd in words which may be underſtood, for without that the Law cannot be obey'd; and a Law that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obey'd, is no Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The meaning of <hi>words</hi> in any Law are to be known, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>ſignification,</hi> according to common acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation before the <hi>Law</hi> made, or from ſome <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Inſtitution</hi> declaring their <hi>ſignification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Interdicts</hi> of marriage and carnal knowledge in the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> were directed formally to the men, not to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are interdicted but by conſequent; for marriage and carnal knowledge being a <hi>reciprocal Act,</hi> and <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be done by one party, it follows that the <hi>woman</hi> being interdicted to the man, the man muſt alſo conſequently be interdicted to the woman, for a man cannot marry a <hi>woman,</hi> and ſhe not <hi>marry</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:99478:162"/>4. The Reaſons why the <hi>Interdict</hi> is ever formally to the man, are, 1. Becauſe in the <hi>prohibited Act</hi> of uncovering the nakedneſs, the man properly is the <hi>primary Agent,</hi> and the woman but patient and conſenting; for a woman can no more uncover the mans nakedneſs <hi>naturally,</hi> than ſhe can raviſh him. 2. The man, after marriage, hath the deduction of the woman, <hi>ad Domum &amp; Thalamum,</hi> and all the civil power over her, and not ſhe over him; but the <hi>womans</hi> conſent to have <hi>her nakedneſs uncovered</hi> is forbid, and makes her conſenting an equal offence with the mans; for by the <hi>Twentieth of Leviticus</hi> the man and woman offending in that kind were to dye, which had not been but that both were <hi>Tranſgreſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The firſt and moſt expreſs Law prohibiting the carnal knowledge of certain perſons in the <hi>Eighteenth Chapter of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> is,—<hi>None of you ſhall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Near of kin</hi> are words of relation, and have no poſitive certainty, nor are intelligible, but relatively to remoter kin; for all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> being of kin in ſome degree;</p>
               <p>A perſon of kin to a man within <hi>two Degrees,</hi> is nearer of kin than one within <hi>four Degrees;</hi> and one within <hi>four Degrees</hi> nearer than one within <hi>eight Degrees;</hi> and ſo interminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, That the Law before cited,—<hi>Not to approach to any near of kin, to uncover their nakedneſs,</hi> had been uſeleſs, without knowing the perſons accepted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be the <hi>near of kin.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>All which are inſtanced in, in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> as prohibited for that reaſon, and many others are of the ſame relation not inſtanced in, as <hi>a mans mothers brother, his fathers father, his mothers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his fathers mother, his mothers mother, his brothers daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his ſiſters daughter,</hi> and others who are <hi>equally near of kin to his near of kin,</hi> as his <hi>immediate</hi> near of kin are to himſelf, and were never doubted to be prohibited within the <hi>Levitical Degrees</hi> by any.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:99478:163"/>
               <p>Whence alſo it appears, That the Inſtances given in this ſecond Rule drawn out of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> are not the Law it ſelf, nor comprehend the extent of it, but are <hi>examples</hi> only of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or <hi>ſecond degree</hi> of <hi>kindred,</hi> comprehended under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law of not approaching to thoſe near of kin, and which are particularly ſpecified by the <hi>Karait Rabbies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all perſons near of kin ſtrictly, to any the ſix perſons firſt interdicted, are likewiſe interdicted by that Law, None ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any near of kin to him to uncover their nakedneſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meaning of the words, <hi>near of kin,</hi> is further proved by theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the Law hath <hi>denominated</hi> the Relations to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted near of kin; (as is done in this caſe) none compriſed under that denomination can be more or leſs near of kin than others ſo denominated. As when the Law denominates a man an <hi>Attorney, Serjeant,</hi> or <hi>the like,</hi> no <hi>Attorney</hi> is more or leſs an <hi>Attorney,</hi> and no <hi>Serjeant</hi> more or leſs a <hi>Serjeant,</hi> than any other <hi>Attorney</hi> or <hi>Serjeant.</hi> And ſo is it in all orders of men of the ſame denomination.</p>
               <p>Therefore it appearing by the Law to be the reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicting a perſon, becauſe near of kin to a mans father or mother, and none of thoſe <hi>ſix Relations</hi> being more or leſs near of kin than the other, the nearneſs of kin to any of them is as much reaſon of interdicting, as the nearneſs of kin to the <hi>father</hi> or <hi>mother,</hi> or any other of them inſtanced in.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon is, becauſe the Law forbidding the <hi>approach to any near of kin,</hi> forbids in that expreſſion the near of kin to any of the <hi>ſix perſons</hi> ſtrictly denominated near of kin, as well as thoſe <hi>ſix perſons</hi> themſelves: For in <hi>Leviticus</hi> a man is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted <hi>his wives daughter, and his wives ſons daughter, and her daughters daughter,</hi> becauſe they are his <hi>wives near kinſwomen,</hi> whereas her daughter only is <hi>the near kinſwoman</hi> to the wife in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, and the other but <hi>near of kin</hi> to <hi>her near of kin,</hi> that is, to her daughter; yet all of them are ſaid to be the <hi>wives near kinſwomen.</hi> So, <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs of thy mothers or fathers ſiſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 20.19.</note> 
                  <hi>for he uncovereth his near kin: before they were ſaid to be the near kin to the mother and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and here to be the ſons near kin.</hi>

               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:99478:164"/>
               <p>The third General Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> prohibiting Rule drawn out of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> is, <hi>A man is prohibited to take a wife, and any other near of kin to her,</hi> which is grounded upon theſe words,<note place="margin">Lev. 18.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of a woman and her daughter; neither ſhalt thou take her ſons daughter, or her daughters daughter, to uncover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, for they are her near kinſwomen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of the <hi>wives near kinſwomen</hi> are here clearly inſtanced in but her <hi>daughter,</hi> not her <hi>mother,</hi> not her <hi>ſiſter,</hi> who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually her <hi>near kinſwomen,</hi> and compriſed in this prohibition, and in the reaſon of it, as well as the <hi>daughter:</hi> For the reaſon of <hi>prohibiting</hi> theſe perſons inſtanced in, being, <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe they are the <hi>wives near kinſwoman,</hi> it is evident that the <hi>wives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>wives ſiſter</hi> are by the ſame reaſon prohibited, for they are her near kinſwomen in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>His wives daughter is literally forbidden the husband, and ſo is (but not ſo <hi>obviouſly</hi>) his wives mother. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</p>
               <p>If he marry the <hi>mother,</hi> the words forbid him her <hi>daughter,</hi> and if he marry the <hi>daughter,</hi> he is prohibited the <hi>mother,</hi> elſe he would <hi>marry a woman and her daughter,</hi> which the words for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, and accordingly by the <hi>Karaits</hi> Doctrine, grounded upon clear expoſition, as I conceive of the <hi>Levitical</hi> prohibitions, the husband is forbidden, as near of kin to his wife,

               <p>From the ſame <hi>Verſe</hi> they deduce a <hi>fourth</hi> Rule,<note place="margin">For theſe Rules vid. Seldens ux. Ebraica, c. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Husband is prohibited the near of kin to his wives near of kin,</hi> as before in the <hi>prohibitions</hi> of conſanguinity; for he is literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited the <hi>daughter</hi> of his wives ſon, and her <hi>daughters daughter,</hi> and by neceſſary inference alſo his wives <hi>grand-mother</hi> by <hi>father and mother,</hi> who are the <hi>near of kin</hi> to his <hi>wives daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and her <hi>mother,</hi> who are his wives <hi>near of kin,</hi> which they thus ſtrongly prove.</p>
               <p>A man is forbidden to take a woman and her <hi>ſons daughter,</hi> or her <hi>daughters daughter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore if a man marry his wives <hi>grand-mother,</hi> he hath taken a <hi>woman</hi> and her <hi>ſons daughter,</hi> or her <hi>daughters daughter,</hi> which is expreſly forbid.</p>
               <p>And in theſe are expreſs inſtances given of prohibiting the <hi>near of kin</hi> to his <hi>wives near of kin,</hi> and are alſo termed his <hi>wives near kinſwomen,</hi> as well as thoſe which ſtrictly are ſo.</p>
               <p>By the ſame reaſon all others <hi>near of kin</hi> to his <hi>wives father, brother,</hi> or <hi>ſiſter,</hi> are prohibited the husband, as well as thoſe <hi>near of kin</hi> to her <hi>mother, her daughter, or ſon,</hi> and are equally <hi>in terminis</hi> within the words, <hi>his wives near kinſwomen,</hi> of which ſort they number <hi>Sixteen,</hi> the ſame with thoſe prohibited in the <hi>ſecond Rule</hi> for Conſanguinity.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable, That the <hi>Parochial Matrimonial Table,</hi> in uſe in <hi>England,</hi> agrees in its prohibitions of marriages, which are <hi>Thirty</hi> in number, for <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> and <hi>Affinity,</hi> with the <hi>Levitical Prohibitions,</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Karait Rabbins</hi> in the <hi>four</hi> former Rules.</p>

               <p>The next thing I ſhall inſiſt on, is, The <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſo ſtiled; Whether they were <hi>re vera</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or not, doubtleſs they are of great, both <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> hath theſe words, as they are publiſhed in the <hi>Canon Law.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> This <hi>Canon</hi> cannot be underſtood of having <hi>two Siſters</hi> for wives at the ſame time, for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> never admitted <hi>two wives,</hi> or more, at one time; and therefore interdicting of <hi>two ſiſters, qua ſiſters,</hi> at a time, was to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> The other part of the <hi>Canon,</hi> which is <hi>aut conſobrinam,</hi> that is, his brother or ſiſters daughter taken to wife, ſhews the <hi>Canon</hi> reſpected only the nearneſs of Relation.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:99478:165"/>
               <p>That clear'd, I reaſon thus, either marrying the wives ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, after the wives death, was lawful when the <hi>Canon</hi> was made, or unlawful, for it relates to an offence done, <hi>qui duxit,</hi> not to a new made offence. If lawful, why then was any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (namely excluſion from the Clergy) inflicted for a lawful Act? If it were unlawful in the Apoſtles time, how is it become now lawful?</p>
               <p>It is true, as the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves on this Subject,<note place="margin">Grot. de Jure Belli. l. 2. c. 5. Sect. 14.</note> A marriage may be unlawful in many reſpects, and yet the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtand good, and the <hi>vinculum matrimonii</hi> not diſſolv'd, but puniſhable ſome other ways, if made unlawful by <hi>Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Precept of the Apoſtles cannot be ſaid of <hi>Humane Authority</hi> only, nor a <hi>new Inſtitution,</hi> as is already noted; nor was there any Divorce for Inceſt among the Iews, as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after, but was always among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> In that time the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtian Church</hi> had no <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Legal Divorce, Separation,</hi> and <hi>Baſtarding</hi> the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> how inceſtuous ſoever the marriage were, for thoſe were <hi>Acts of Juriſdiction and Coercion,</hi> and could not be done but by the power of Laws, to which the parties were locally ſubject. But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Church power</hi> was only to forbid them communion with the reſt of their brethren <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and to deny the Offenders ſuch things as were in their power, namely, to be of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as was done by this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appears by St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 5.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5 1.</note> 
                  <hi>It is reported there is fornication among you, and ſuch fornication as is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles, That one ſhould have his Fathers wife; which was an Inceſt of the higheſt degree, although denoted by the word</hi>

               <p>Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> could do no more but direct the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from <hi>Communion</hi> with that man, and to put away from among them that wicked perſon: He could neither null his marriage, nor illegitimate his Iſſue, if he had any, nor put the Offender to death, according to the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> for theſe are effects of the <hi>Civil Power;</hi> and among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> no Divorce was for <hi>Inceſt,</hi> but the marriage was void, and the <hi>Inceſt</hi> puniſht,<note place="margin">Seld.

               <p>The next thing obſervable from this <hi>Canon,</hi> is, That the Makers were of opinion that the <hi>marriage</hi> with the <hi>Conſobrina,</hi> or <hi>brother</hi> or <hi>ſiſters daughter,</hi> was equally unlawful as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>two ſiſters,</hi> and the puniſhment by the <hi>Canon</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.</p>
               <p>Whence it follows, That the Makers of the <hi>Canon,</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles or others, did in thoſe <hi>two Caſes</hi> follow the expoſition of the <hi>Karaits,</hi> and not of the <hi>Talmudiſts:</hi> The <hi>Karaits</hi> holding both marriages unlawful, but the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> holding neither unlawful by <hi>Moſes's Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by what <hi>Law Divine</hi> the <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>ſucceeding Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches</hi> conceived themſelves obliged (as generally they did, and do) in the <hi>matter of marriage,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal prohibitions</hi> ſtrictly and indiſpenſably, is a queſtion of great difficulty: But ſurely they took their meaſures of thoſe Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions from the Doctrine of the <hi>Karaits,</hi> more than from the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> though the laſt were of more Authority in the <hi>Hebrews Commonwealth,</hi> as appears by that of <hi>Matthew cap. 23. v. 2, 3. The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Seat, all therefore they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> Nor was it without reaſon done, for ſuch of thoſe degrees which are not particularly ſpecified in the <hi>Eighteenth of Leviticus</hi> (for in thoſe the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Karaits</hi> agree) but are deduc'd by <hi>Argument</hi> to be prohibited.<note place="margin">Seld.

               <p>Nor is it ſtrange that the Opinions of private men prevail above the publick in proceſs of time.

               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:99478:166"/>
               <p>By a <hi>Canon</hi> of another very ancient <hi>Provincial Council,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Concilium Eliberinum,</hi> under Pope <hi>Silveſter, Three hundred and fourteen years</hi> after Chriſt, and before the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> by the <hi>Sixteenth Canon</hi> of that <hi>Council—Si quis poſt obitum Uxoris ſuae ſororem ejus duxerit per quinquennium à communione abſtineat.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By this ſo ancient Council, marrying the wives ſiſter was accompted unlawful but for the ſame reaſons as before; they could puniſh it no otherwiſe than by wayes in the power of the <hi>Church,</hi> which was to hinder the Offender from <hi>Communion</hi> for <hi>five years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this Council they followed the <hi>expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raits</hi> alſo concerning marriages, and not of the <hi>Talmudiſts;</hi> nor is it rational to conceive, that <hi>Canons</hi> then forbidding any ſort of marriage, proceeded from an Arbitrary power, aſſumed by thoſe who made them, as Law makers, to which they could no way pretend, but becauſe it was unlawful by the Principles and Perſuaſion of all <hi>Chriſtian Believers.</hi>

                     <hi>That marriage made with a perſon pre-contracted, or with a perſon naturally impotent, could not have been impeached in order to a Divorce, by reaſon of the Statute of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>but becauſe ſuch marriages are againſt Gods Law.</hi> Yet they are not <hi>marriages</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Levitical degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>marriage</hi> in queſtion therefore, though by way of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> not within the <hi>Levitical prohibitions,</hi> if it be within the <hi>Levitical degrees</hi> at all, and whether unlawful or lawful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and by what Law ſoever ſo <hi>unlawful</hi> or <hi>lawful,</hi> cannot be prohibited to be <hi>impeached</hi> by the <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi> by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>For that <hi>Act</hi> prohibits the impeaching of marriages only which are abſolutely without the <hi>Levitical degrees,</hi> leaving all other to the <hi>Spiritual Juriſdiction</hi> as before the <hi>Act</hi> of 32. Now</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Levitical degrees</hi> are to be reckon'd by the perſons whoſe carnal knowledge is forbidden a man in reſpect of <hi>Conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Affinity</hi> by the <hi>Law of Moſes.</hi> As the carnal knowledge of <hi>the mother, the fathers wife, the ſons wife, &amp;c.</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity</hi> of the <hi>wives daughter, her daughters daughter, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Affinity.</hi> And it is plain, <hi>the wives ſiſter</hi> is prohibited in ſome reſpect of <hi>Affinity,</hi> by the words, <hi>Neither ſhalt thou take a wife to her ſiſter, to vex her:</hi> Therefore her marriage with her ſiſters husband is a marriage within the <hi>Levitical degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And agreed on all ſides to be unlawful within the degrees, if during the wives life; but doubted if <hi>unlawful</hi> after her death.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is certain the <hi>wives</hi> husband was reſtrained from taking his wives ſiſter as he might take another <hi>woman,</hi> that is, either <hi>during his wives life,</hi> or <hi>after:</hi> Therefore his marriage with her was within the <hi>Levitical degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it muſt be clearly without thoſe degrees, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of it may be prohibited by the <hi>Act of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">This marriage permitted lawful by the Canon Law, where uſed. Decret. Greg. l. 4.

                  <p>So if a man marry his <hi>fathers brothers wife,</hi> it is a marriage within the <hi>Levitical degrees.</hi> Yet if the fathers brother were by the <hi>half blood</hi> only of the <hi>mothers ſide,</hi> the <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> held ſuch marriage not unlawful by the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> but by the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of the <hi>Elders.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>One <hi>Man</hi> was ſued before the High Commiſſioners,<note place="margin">Mans Caſe, Moore's Rep. f. 907. a.</note> 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for marrying his wives ſiſters daughter, and a Prohibition was granted, as <hi>Moore</hi> Reports the Caſe, becauſe the <hi>marriage</hi> was not prohibited by the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> which was no Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crook</hi> reports the ſame Caſe,<note place="margin">Crook. 33 El. f. 228. Mans Caſe.</note> and that a <hi>prohibition</hi> was granted, but that a <hi>conſultation</hi> was after granted, and that a ſentence of <hi>Divorce</hi> was given.</p>
                  <p>In reporting this Caſe of <hi>Mans, Juſtice Crook's</hi> words are, <hi>A Conſultation was granted, becauſe the Prohibition is not to be, if the marriage be not within the Levitical degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a great miſtake; for if the <hi>marriage</hi> be within the <hi>Levitical degrees,</hi> no <hi>prohibition</hi> ought to iſſue; for it ought not to be but when the <hi>marriage</hi> is without the <hi>Levitical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he adds, <hi>But here the prohibition was general, and therefore not good;</hi> which is not intelligible, whatever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it.</p>
                  <p>For by the <hi>Libel</hi> it muſt neceſſarily appear to the Court, That the <hi>marriage</hi> in queſtion was either <hi>without the Levitical degrees,</hi> or <hi>within them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it <hi>were</hi> without the degrees, the Court did moſt unjuſtly to grant the <hi>Conſultation,</hi> for it ought not to have been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>marriage</hi> were within the <hi>Levitical degrees,</hi> it had been <hi>unjuſt</hi> not to grant a <hi>Conſultation.</hi>

                  <p>By the Reviver in <hi>1 Eliz. of 28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> and of every Clauſe in it, <hi>All marriages prohibited by Gods Law, limited and declared by 28 H. 8. c. 7. were again unlawful,</hi> as before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> notwithſtanding any <hi>Diſpenſation.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Therefore</hi> the <hi>Statute of 28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi> was revived by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver</hi> of the <hi>Statute of 28 H. 8. c. 16. in 1 Eliz.</hi> and made as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual as before it was repeal'd, and ſo it continues.</p>
                  <p>If it had been enacted by Parliament after the Repeal of the Clauſe in <hi>28 H. 8. c. 7. That all marriages prohibited by Gods Law, limited and declared by 28 H. 8. c. 7. ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> notwithſtanding any <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> that enacting had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the Clauſe in <hi>28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore the ſame thing being enacted by revival of <hi>28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> muſt have the ſame effect of reviving that Clauſe in <hi>28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will put it, for more clearneſs, by way of a Caſe; A man before the <hi>Third of November, 26 H. 8.</hi> by <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> had married his wives ſiſters daughter, which marriage was prohibited by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and no Divorce had been attempted in the Caſe until after <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver of the <hi>Statute of 28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> which made void all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is plain, That this marriage being not prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> limited and declared in the <hi>Act of 28 H. 8. c. 7:</hi> was by the expreſs words of the reviv'd <hi>Act of 28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to continue good without ſeparation, notwithſtanding all <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> were null'd; becauſe it was no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage excepted out of the Grace intended and given by that Act <hi>to the Kings Subjects</hi> married by <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> before <hi>November the Third, 26 H. 8.</hi> and not then ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>But if a marriage before the <hi>Third of November, 26 H. 8.</hi> had been by <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> between the brother and ſiſter, or as this Caſe is between the husband and his wives ſiſter, and no Separation attempted until after <hi>1 Eliz.</hi> and the Reviver of the <hi>Act of 28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> Theſe marriages were not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue good, and without Separation by <hi>28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> becauſe they were marriages particularly excepted out of the Grace granted by that Act, as being prohibited by Gods Law, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and declared in the <hi>Act of 28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi> which proves <hi>28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi> to be in force by the Reviver of <hi>28 H. 8. c. 16.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the marriage in queſtion to be clearly againſt Gods Law, which is the thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Statute of 28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi> there are <hi>two Clauſes</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marriages, <hi>The firſt declaring certain marriages there recited, to be within the degrees prohibited by Gods Law,</hi> which Clauſe concerns the preſent <hi>queſtion,</hi> and is before cited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond Clauſe,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Be it therefore enacted, That no perſon or perſons, Subjects or Reſiants of this Realm, or in any your Dominions, of what eſtate, degree, or degrees ſoever they be, ſhall from henceforth marry within the degrees afore rehearſed, what pretence ſoever ſhall be made to the contrary thereof. Then it proceeds,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:99478:172"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That if there were any Divorce or Separation made of any ſuch marriages by the Arch-biſhops or Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch Separation ſhould remain good, and not be revokable by any Authority; and the Children procreated under ſuch unlawful mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſhould be illegitimate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if any ſuch marriages were in any the Kings Dominions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Separation, that there ſhould be a ſeparation from the Bonds of ſuch unlawful marriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we muſt obſerve, the <hi>Act of 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c. 8.</hi> doth not repeal this Act entirely of <hi>28 H. 8. c. 7.</hi> but repeals only one Clauſe of it; the words of which Clauſe of Repeal are before cited, and manifeſt this <hi>ſecond Clauſe</hi> of the <hi>Act of 28 H. 8.</hi> and not the firſt to be the Clauſe intended to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd.</p>
                  <p>For there was no reaſon to repeal the Clauſe declaratory of <hi>marriages</hi> prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acknowledged; nor do the words of <hi>Repeal</hi> import a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing concerning marriages within degrees prohibited by Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>But (as the time then was) there was reaſon to repeal a Clauſe enacting all Separations of ſuch marriages with which the <hi>Pope</hi> had diſpenc'd, ſhould remain good againſt his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that ſuch marriages with which he had diſpenc'd, not yet ſeparated, ſhould be ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>And the words of the Clauſe of Repeal manifeſt the ſecond Clauſe to be intended, <hi>viz. All that part of the Act made in the ſaid Eight and twentieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which concerneth a prohibition to marry within the degrees expreſſed in the ſaid Act, ſhall be repeal'd, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is true, That if a marriage be declared by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be againſt <hi>Gods Law,</hi> we muſt admit it to be ſo; for by a Law (that is, by an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi>) it is ſo declared.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame reaſon, if by a <hi>lawful Canon,</hi> a marriage be declared to be <hi>againſt Gods Law,</hi> we muſt admit it to be ſo; for a lawful <hi>Canon</hi> is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as well as an <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> And whatever is the <hi>Law of the Kingdom,</hi> is as much the <hi>Law</hi> as any thing elſe that is ſo; for what is <hi>Law</hi> doth not <hi>ſuſcipere magis aut minus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by a lawful <hi>Canon</hi> of this Kingdom, which is enough, and not only ſo, but by a <hi>Canon</hi> warranted by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> the marriage in queſtion is declared to be prohibited by <hi>Gods Law,</hi> therefore we muſt admit it to be ſo.</p>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:99478:175"/>
                  <hi>3.</hi> If it were a good Patent in the Creation, nor was void by the death of <hi>King James,</hi> Whether the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the <hi>Act of 12 Car. 2. Saving all the Right of the Maſter, Wardens, Freemen and Commonalty of <hi>Vintners</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi>
                  </hi> hath preſerved all that Right which they had by the Patent of <hi>9 Jac.</hi> againſt the <hi>Act of 12 Car. 2?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> I conceive, That if the <hi>Patent, 9 Jac.</hi> were not void in the Creation, it remained good after the death of <hi>King James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If it were not void in the Creation, nor by the death of <hi>King James,</hi> all Right that the <hi>Maſter, Wardens, Freemen and Commonalty of <hi>Vintners</hi>
                  </hi> had by it, is ſtill preſerved by the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> in the <hi>Act of 12 Car. 2.</hi> but if the <hi>Patent of 9 Jac.</hi> was void in its Creation, or by the death of <hi>King James,</hi> then the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the <hi>Act of 12 Car. 2.</hi> aids them not at all.</p>
               <p>So as now it is only inſiſted on, That the Patent of <hi>9 Jac.</hi> was void in its Creation, for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> For that the Law of <hi>7 E. 6.</hi> was ſuch a Law, <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> could not <hi>diſpence</hi> againſt it, more than with ſome other <hi>penal Laws, pro bono publico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> If he could to particular perſons, he could not to the Corporation of <hi>Vintners,</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> whoſe number or perſons the <hi>King</hi> could never know; and that it ſtood not with the truſt repoſed in him by the Law, to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> ſo <hi>generally</hi> without any proſpect of <hi>number</hi> or <hi>perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Books</hi> have been plentifully urg'd at the <hi>Barr,</hi> and by my <hi>Brothers,</hi> who argued before me, therefore I ſhall not <hi>Actum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere</hi> to repeat them.</p>
               <p>But I obſerved not that any ſteddy Rule hath been drawn from the Caſes cited to guid a mans <hi>Judgment,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> may, or may not <hi>diſpence</hi> in <hi>penal Laws,</hi> excepting that <hi>old Rule</hi> taken from the <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 H. 7. f. 11, 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That with <hi>Malum prohibitum</hi> by Stat. the King may diſpence, but not with <hi>Malum per ſe.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I think that <hi>Rule</hi> hath more confounded mens Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on that <hi>ſubject,</hi> than rectified them.</p>
               <p>Yet I conceive that <hi>Caſe,</hi> and the Inſtances given in it, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, to be the beſt key afforded by our <hi>Books,</hi> to open this dark Learning (as it ſeems to me) of <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> to which therefore I ſhall only or principally apply my ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:99478:175"/>
               <p>Before I enter upon it, I muſt previouſly aſſent, <hi>That every act a man is naturally enabled to do, is in it ſelf equally good, as any other act he is ſo enabled to do.</hi> And ſo all the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, That <hi>Actus qua actus non eſt malus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.15.</note> And that <hi>mens</hi> acts are good or bad only as they are <hi>precepted</hi> or <hi>prohibited</hi> by a <hi>Law,</hi> according to that Truth, <hi>Where there is no law there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> Whence it follows, That every <hi>Malum</hi> is in truth a <hi>Malum prohibitum</hi> by ſome Law.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I mean by the word <hi>(Diſpenſation)</hi> when I uſe it, another thing than ſome of my <hi>Brothers</hi> defined it to be, namely, <hi>That it was Liberatio à poena;</hi> or as others, <hi>That it is provida relaxatio Juris,</hi> which is defining an <hi>ignotum per ignotius,</hi> but <hi>liberare à poena,</hi> is the proper effect of a <hi>pardon,</hi> not of a <hi>diſpenſation; For a diſpenſation obtained doth <hi>jus dare,</hi> and makes the thing prohibited lawful to be done by him who hath it,</hi> upon which depends the true reaſon of many Caſes which admit not of <hi>diſpenſation;</hi> but a <hi>pardon frees from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for a thing unlawfully done.</hi> Yet freedom from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a conſequent of a <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> though not its <hi>effect.</hi> But ſo it is alſo a <hi>conſequent</hi> of repealing the Law, and a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> of an <hi>exception</hi> at the making of the Law of ſome particular perſon or perſons from being bound by the Law.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Caſe it ſelf of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> wherein I agree, That with <hi>Malum prohibitum</hi> by <hi>Stat.</hi> indefinitely underſtood the <hi>King</hi> may <hi>diſpenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I deny that the King can diſpenſe with every <hi>Malum prohibitum</hi> by <hi>Statute,</hi> though prohibited by <hi>Statute</hi> only.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> The King may pardon <hi>Nuſances</hi> that are tranſient, and not continuing, as a <hi>Nuſance</hi> in the High-way, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, and is not ended, until removed; cannot be <hi>pardon'd:</hi> So of a <hi>Water-courſe</hi> diverted, or a <hi>Bridge</hi> broken down,<note place="margin">Cok.

               </p>
               <p>But breaking the <hi>Aſſiſe of Bread and Ale, foreſtalling the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, ingroſſing, regrating, or the like,</hi> which continue not, but which are over aſſoon as done, until done <hi>de novo</hi> again, may be <hi>pardon'd,</hi> like other <hi>offences:</hi> So as the <hi>Offender</hi> ſhall not be impleaded for them, otherwiſe than by perſons who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd particular damage, which the King cannot remit; this difference holds in offences by <hi>penal Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:99478:176"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">22 Car. 2. c. 8.</note>So a <hi>Mayor</hi> or <hi>Bayliff</hi> of a <hi>Town,</hi> or other <hi>Toll-taker,</hi> who is penally bound to provide <hi>true Market meaſures,</hi> and doth not, cannot be pardon'd by the King, becauſe the fault ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; but the <hi>puniſhment inflicted</hi> the King may <hi>pardon.</hi> But by a Law all theſe offences may be <hi>pardon'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is generally true, that <hi>malum per ſe</hi> cannot be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with; but thence to inferr (as many do) that every <hi>malum</hi> which the King cannot diſpenſe with is <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> is not true.</p>
               <p>Nor is there in that Caſe any ſufficient deſignation of what is <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> and why to prevent error in diſquiſition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, though ſome inſtances thereof, <hi>mala per ſe,</hi> be very right.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to in ſtance in ſeveral kinds of <hi>mala per ſe,</hi> which cannot be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with, and in ſome <hi>mala prohibita</hi> by <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> and otherwiſe, which the <hi>King</hi> alſo cannot <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with; and to give the reaſon why he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in both, thereby to make the concluſion I drive at leſs confuſed, which is to differ <hi>penal Laws diſpenſable from thoſe which are not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Murther, Adultery, Stealing, Inceſt, Sacriledge, Extortion, Perjury, Treſpaſs, and many other of the like kind,</hi> all men will agree to be <hi>mala per ſe,</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable:</hi> All which are <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,</hi> and by <hi>Statutes.</hi> Nor is it much to ſay, thoſe are alſo prohibited by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and therefore cannot be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with, if that were the reaſon, nothing prohibited at the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> could be diſpens'd with, which is not ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Where the Suit is only the <hi>Kings</hi> for breach of a Law, which is not to the particular damage of any third perſon, the King may <hi>diſpenſe;</hi> but where the Suit is only the <hi>Kings,</hi> but for the <hi>benefit and ſafety</hi> of a third perſon, and the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi> to the Suit by the proſecution and complaint of ſuch third perſon, the King cannot <hi>releaſe, diſcharge,</hi> or <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the Suit, but by conſent and agreement of the <hi>party</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. As where, upon <hi>complaint</hi> of any perſon, a man hath entred into <hi>Recognizance</hi> to keep the Peace againſt ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the King cannot <hi>diſcharge</hi> ſuch Recognizance before it be forfeited; but the party whoſe ſafety is concerned may, though the King only can ſue the Recognizance.

               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:99478:176"/>
               <p>As the <hi>Laws of Nuſances</hi> are <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> ſo are all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>penal Laws;</hi> and if a <hi>Nuſance</hi> cannot be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with for that reaſon, it follows, no <hi>penal Law,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, can be diſpens'd with.</p>
               <p>Therefore the reaſon is, becauſe the parties particularly da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged by a <hi>Nuſance,</hi> have their Actions on the Caſe for their damage, whereof the King cannot deprive them by his <hi>diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:</hi> And by the ſame reaſon, other <hi>penal Laws,</hi> the breach of which are to mens particular damage, cannot be diſpens'd with.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Nor is it enough to make a thing <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited at <hi>Common Law:</hi> But the reaſon is,</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Murther (ex vi termini,</hi> in the Language it is us'd in) ſignifies <hi>unlawful killing</hi> a man. The word <hi>Adultery,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Copulation; <hi>Stealing,</hi> unlawful taking from another; <hi>Perjury,</hi> unlawful ſwearing; and <hi>Treſpaſs, ex vi termini,</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful impriſonment, or unlawful entry, <hi>or the like,</hi> upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Houſe or Lands, and ſo do the other <hi>mala</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>If theſe <hi>mala</hi> might be diſpens'd with, in regard a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I ſaid. makes the thing to be done lawful to him who is diſpens'd with, it follows, that the <hi>diſpenſation</hi> would make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful killing, which the word <hi>Murther</hi> imports, <hi>vi termini,</hi> to be lawful; unlawful taking from another, which the word <hi>Stealing</hi> imports, to be lawful; unlawful <hi>Swearing,</hi> which <hi>Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> imports, to be <hi>lawful;</hi> an <hi>unlawful</hi> Entry upon a mans Houſe or Land, which the word <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> imports, to be lawful, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>So the ſame thing, at the ſame time, would be both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unlawful, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſon, a Law making <hi>Murther, Stealing, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Treſpaſs,</hi> or any the reſt of the <hi>mala</hi> inſtanc'd in lawful, would be a void Law in it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:99478:177"/>
               <p>For a <hi>Law which a man cannot obey, nor act according to it, is void, and no Law:</hi> And it is impoſſible to obey contradictions, or act according to them.</p>
               <p>Therefore I may conclude thoſe things to be <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> which can never be made lawful.</p>
               <p>The inſtances in that Book of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> are none of theſe, but near them: the words are, <hi>But malum in ſe, the King, nor any other can diſpenſe.</hi> And inſtanceth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si Come, ſi le Roy, voyloit pardon de occider un homme ou de faire nuſance in le haut chemin, ceo eſt void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where by the way, <hi>pardon</hi> is miſ-printed for <hi>pocar done,</hi> for the King may <hi>pardon</hi> killing a man; but if the <hi>King</hi> will give <hi>power to kill</hi> a man, or to make a <hi>nuſance</hi> in the High-way, it is void.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame reaſon, a licence to impriſon a man, to take his <hi>Land,</hi> his <hi>Horſe,</hi> or any thing that is his from him, is void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in life, liberty, and eſtate, every man who hath not forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, hath a property and right which the Law allows him to defend; and if it be violated, it gives an Action to redreſs the wrong, and to puniſh the wrong-doer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore a <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> that is, to make lawful the taking from a man any thing which he may lawfully defend from being taken, or lawfully puniſh if it be, muſt be void.</p>
               <p>For it is a contradiction to make it <hi>lawful,</hi> to take what may be <hi>lawfully</hi> hindred from being taken, or <hi>lawfully</hi> puniſhed, if it be.</p>
               <p>And that were to make two men have ſeveral <hi>plenary rights</hi> in the ſame thing at the ſame time, which no <hi>Law</hi> can effect: Therefore <hi>to do a thing which no Law can make lawful, muſt be malum in ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe inſtances differ from the former; for killing a man, or taking from him his Lands or Goods, do not import, <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> that which is unlawful, as <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Stealing</hi> do; for in many Caſes <hi>killing</hi> a man, or taking his <hi>liberty</hi> or <hi>goods</hi> from him, is lawful, and where it is not, may by a Law be made ſo, which the other can never be.</p>
               <p>As every new <hi>capital puniſhment</hi> ordained by Law, makes kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man lawful where it was not before; every new <hi>aid</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of mens eſtate, makes a taking from men <hi>lawful</hi> that was not before.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:99478:178"/>
               <p>But this is becauſe a <hi>Law can alter, change, or transferr a mans property in life, liberty, eſtate, or any intereſt, as it will, which cannot be done without a Law, and thereby nothing unlawful is made lawful:</hi> But the property which a man had, and was the ſubject matter of the unlawful doing or taking before, is alter'd or transferred to another, either <hi>in toto</hi> or <hi>in tanto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as to <hi>violate</hi> mens <hi>properties</hi> is never lawful, but a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum per ſe,</hi> as that Book is of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> and according to that of <hi>Bracton;</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>But to alter or transferr mens properties to others, is no <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> it is daily done by the owners expreſs conſent, and by a <hi>Law</hi> without their expreſs conſent.</p>
               <p>And as the Law is, the <hi>Lord</hi> of a <hi>Villain</hi> may transferr his <hi>Villains property,</hi> in Lands or Goods, to himſelf, by entry or ſeiſure: And it is the ſignal difference between a <hi>Freeman</hi> and <hi>Villain,</hi> that it cannot be done to a <hi>Freeman,</hi> nor yet to a <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> to the uſe of any but his Lord.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Si quem Lex occidi praecipiat aut res alicujus auferri, non lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fiet homicidium aut furtum (quae voces vitium involvunt) ſed non erit homicidium aut furtum quod a lege vitae &amp; rerum poteſtatem habente, auctore fit.</hi>

               <p>If any need further ſatisfaction concerning what hath been ſaid on this occaſion, he may reſort with ſucceſs to the place quoted of that <hi>great Lawyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerved, That <hi>altering</hi> or <hi>changing</hi> property is no ſubject matter for a <hi>diſpenſation.</hi> A man is not <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with to do an act which he cannot do, but to do an act which ſimply he can do, but the Law prohibits his doing it, <hi>penally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But altering or changing property is an act <hi>ſimply</hi> out of his power to do, which ſhould be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with in that behalf.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:99478:178"/>
               <p>And thus we ſee violation of property is a <hi>malum per ſe</hi> by that Book of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> and the reaſon why it is ſo, and cannot be diſpens'd with.</p>
               <p>A third kind of <hi>malum per ſe</hi> by that Caſe of <hi>11 H. 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11 H. 7.</note> is that which the Law of the Land admits to be ſpecially prohibited, <hi>Jure Divino, Et Iſint le Roy, ne nul Eveſque ou Presbiter poit doner licence a un de faire Lechery, Quia eſt malum in ſe,</hi> ſaith the Book, that is <hi>Coition</hi> without wedlock, which offence, when by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, injures no property, having two husbands or two wives at the ſame time; but that is alſo againſt the property of the firſt husband or wife, <hi>marriage</hi> within the <hi>Levitical degrees.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">32 H. 8. c. 38.</note> All which are admitted by the Law of the Land to be <hi>prohibited, Jure Divino,</hi> and cannot be <hi>diſpenc'd</hi> with; <hi>For no Human authority can make lawful what Divine authority hath made unlawful, without Gods leave, and then it is by his authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many more particulars fall under this head, which I ſhall not now mention. Hence I infer <hi>mala in ſe</hi> to be only ſuch as imply a contradiction to be made lawful, and conſequently what may be made lawful by Human Law to be no <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> as not differing from other things which may be permitted or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited occaſionally, at the pleaſure of the Law-maker.</p>
               <p>The King cannot diſpenſe with a <hi>Nuſance</hi> to the <hi>High-ways</hi> by <hi>11 H. 7.</hi> and conſequently, as ſome think, with no other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Nuſance,</hi> by Sir <hi>Edward Coke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cok. Pleas of the Crown, f. 237. c. 105.</note> For all common <hi>Nuſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as not <hi>repairing Bridges, High-ways, &amp;c.</hi> the Suit is the <hi>Kings,</hi> but he cannot <hi>pardon</hi> or <hi>diſcharge</hi> the <hi>Nuſance</hi> or the Suit for the ſame, the <hi>High-ways</hi> being neceſſary to ſupport ſuch of his Subjects as are occaſioned to travel them: Of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſpecifical offences, which are <hi>publique Nuſances,</hi> I do not reckon to be <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> as ſome do, becauſe though it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted none of them can be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with, yet a Law may make them lawful; and if ſo, they are not <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>But either a <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> or a Law to commit <hi>Nuſances</hi> (in thoſe terms) I conceive to be <hi>void,</hi> becauſe the word <hi>Nuſance</hi> imports a thing, <hi>vi termini,</hi> that is unlawful as <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> doth; and therefore it is a contradiction to make it lawful by a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation</hi> or <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by a <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>Baker</hi> or <hi>Victualler</hi> may ſell Bread or Ale of ſuch <hi>weight</hi> or <hi>meaſure</hi> as he pleaſeth, and as they did before the <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> was made. By a <hi>Law</hi> a <hi>Water-courſe</hi> may be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Corn</hi> growing in the field, or <hi>Proviſion</hi> going to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket may be bought up by the way, which are <hi>Nuſances in Specie,</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:99478:179"/> ſo of the reſt; and therefore not <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> as ſome have thought, but <hi>mala politica,</hi> as they are prohibited.</p>
               <p>But obſtructing a <hi>High-way,</hi> diverting a <hi>Water-courſe,</hi> breaking down a <hi>Bridge,</hi> breaking the <hi>Aſſiſe of Bread and Ale,</hi> cannot be <hi>diſpens'd</hi> with, though they are only puniſhable by the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe ſuch a <hi>Diſpenſation would take away the Action of thoſe who had particular damage by the offence done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> to buy the ſtanding Corn of ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, or field, or a certain proviſion going to ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſuch a Market-day, may be good, for no man can declare upon a particular damage to himſelf thereby, for if any man could, every man could; but a <hi>general diſpenſation</hi> in either kind, were an <hi>abrogation</hi> of the Laws which prohibit them, which cannot be.</p>
               <p>Next, ſome <hi>Nuſances</hi> are <hi>permanent,</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> ſtill, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til removed, as <hi>Ditches, Hedges,</hi> or other obſtructions to the <hi>High-ways, diverting Water-courſes, decay of Bridges;</hi> theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>pardon'd,</hi> nor the Suit for them, until removed; but breaking the <hi>Aſſiſe of Bread</hi> and <hi>Ale,</hi> buying proviſion in the way to <hi>Market, ingroſſing</hi> a certain quantity of <hi>Corn,</hi> theſe are <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Nuſances,</hi> as I conceive, which continue not, but ceaſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til done <hi>de novo,</hi> and ſuch may be pardon'd, and the Suit for them (as I conceive).</p>
               <p>And note, if a man have particular damage by a foundrous way, he is generally without remedy, though the <hi>Nuſance</hi> is to be puniſht by the King. The reaſon is,</p>
               <p>Becauſe a <hi>foundrous way,</hi> a <hi>decay'd Bridge,</hi> or the like, are commonly to be <hi>repaired</hi> by ſome <hi>Townſhip, Vill, Hamlet,</hi> or a <hi>County</hi> who are not <hi>corporate,</hi> and therefore no action lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for a particular <hi>damage,</hi> but their neglects are to be preſented, and they puniſh'd by fine to the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a particular <hi>perſon,</hi> or <hi>Body Corporate,</hi> be to repair a certain <hi>High-way,</hi> or portion of it, or a <hi>Bridge,</hi> and a man is endamaged particularly by the <hi>foundrouſneſs</hi> of the way, or decay of the <hi>Bridge,</hi> he may have his Action againſt the perſon or Body Corporate,<note place="margin">11 H. 4. f. 83. a. Rolls. Actions ſur Caſe, f. 104. l. 2.</note> who ought to repair for his damage, becauſe he can bring his Action againſt them; but where there is no <hi>perſon</hi> againſt whom to bring his Action, it is as if a man be damaged by one that cannot be known.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:99478:179"/>
               <p>Though no perſon, Natural or Corporate, can have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a <hi>publick Nuſance,</hi> or puniſh it, but the <hi>King,</hi> upon <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment</hi> or <hi>indictment,</hi> as appears <hi>3 E. 2.</hi> Where the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Commonalty of London</hi> brought an Action upon the <hi>Statute</hi> for <hi>foreſtalling</hi> the Markets,<note place="margin">Fitz. Action ſur le Stat. 3 E. 2. n. 26. which ſhews it muſt be the Stat. de Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus in 31 E. 1.</note> and after ſelling at double the rate, becauſe no particular damage was alledg'd, without which the Suit was only the <hi>Kings,</hi> the Plaintiffs had nothing by their Action.</p>
               <p>For if by any publique <hi>Nuſance</hi> a man have a particular <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 H. 8. 26, 27. Cok. Litt. f. 56. a, Cok. pl. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. tit. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> he may have his Action on the Caſe againſt the <hi>Nuſance-maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon why the King cannot diſpenſe in ſuch Caſes, is, not only as <hi>Nuſances</hi> are <hi>contra bonum publicum,</hi> but becauſe if a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> might make it lawful to do a <hi>Nuſance,</hi> which differs from a Licence, to continue a <hi>Nuſance</hi> in the reaſon of it, the perſon damaged by it would be deprived of his Action, for an Action cannot lye for doing that which was <hi>lawfully</hi> done; and it is the ſame to alter or change property, by making what is mine to be lawfully another mans, as to licence another to <hi>damage</hi> me, and I ſhall have no Action or Remedy for it: And no offence againſt a penal Law could be diſpenc'd with, if the reaſon of not diſpenſing were becauſe the offence is <hi>contra bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num publicum,</hi> for all offences by penal Laws are ſuch.</p>
               <p>And it is obſervable, That if upon the Retorn of an <hi>Ad quod dampnum</hi> it appear to be <hi>ad dampnum vel prejudicium</hi> of no man,<note place="margin">Cro. 8 Car. 1. f. 266, 267.

                  <p>Secondly, If one might have an <hi>Action</hi> for ſuch offences, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might have the like, therefore ſuch offences are only to the <hi>King's damage</hi> in his publique <hi>Capacity</hi> of <hi>Supreme Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and wronging <hi>none</hi> but himſelf, he may (as every man elſe may) diſpenſe with his own wrong, when it is <hi>abſque dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no &amp; injuria aliorum.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. If <hi>Exportation, Importation</hi> of a Commodity, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a <hi>Trade</hi> be prohibited generally by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and no cauſe expreſſed of the <hi>Prohibition,</hi> a licence may be granted to one or more without <hi>limitation</hi> to Export or Import, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Trade: For by ſuch <hi>general Reſtraint</hi> the end of the <hi>Law</hi> is conceived to be no more than to <hi>limit</hi> the over-numerous <hi>Exporters, Importers,</hi> or <hi>Traders</hi> in that kind, by putting them to the difficulty of procuring <hi>licences,</hi> and not otherwiſe, and therefore ſuch general licences ſhall not be accounted <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In ſuch Caſes the <hi>Law implies</hi> the King may licence as well as if the <hi>prohibitory Law</hi> had been that no ſuch Importation, Exportation, or Trading ſhould be without the <hi>King's expreſs licence,</hi> in which Caſe the <hi>licence</hi> requires no <hi>limitation</hi> to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Where the King may <hi>diſpenſe</hi> generally he is not bound to it, but may limit his <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> if he think fit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If to <hi>avoid</hi> a <hi>Monopoly</hi> his <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> upon all <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitory Laws</hi> generally muſt by Law be limited; his limited <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> may be for greater quantities than were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or Exported before the Reſtraint, becauſe the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> is left indefinite, and may be any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity certain, and conſequently the end of the Reſtraint equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruſtrated, and the <hi>Monopoly</hi> as effectual as if the Licence had been general, though it be limited.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If a Commodity be prohibited to be Exported or Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe too great quantities of it is carried out, or brought in, the Licences ought to be limited to anſwer the end of the Act.</p>

                  <p>Now if it ſhall be ſaid, That <hi>High-ways,</hi> the <hi>Water-ſtreams, Tolls of Markets, Fines of Jurors, and the like,</hi> are the <hi>Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> as well as his <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> are; and therefore the <hi>King,</hi> as to them, may <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Corporations,</hi> Then</p>
                  <p>It is clear, That <hi>penal Laws</hi> (the breach of which enables no man to an Action for his damage thereby) and the forfeiture and puniſhment for <hi>breaking</hi> them are much more the <hi>Kings Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, <hi>ex conceſſo,</hi> the King may <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as to them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pl. Com. f. 487 Nicholls C.</note>2. The King cannot <hi>diſpenſe</hi> in any Caſe, but with his own Right, and not with the Right of any other. And every Right of the <hi>Crown</hi> is its Inheritance or Intereſt: Therefore where the King can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> at all, he hath an <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and conſequently where he can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> at all, he may <hi>diſpenſe</hi> to a <hi>Corporation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Laws of 7 <hi>E.</hi> 6. and 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. had been penn'd thus, <hi>Every man that ſells Wine contrary to this Act, ſhall pay the King Two pence for every pint ſo ſold;</hi> this <hi>Two pence</hi> had been a Duty and Inheritance to the King, as his Cuſtomes are, without difference; and as the Duty of <hi>Six pence</hi> lately was upon every quart of <hi>French Wine</hi> retail'd. Why then, the greater or leſs the Duty be, alters not the nature of the <hi>King's Inheritance</hi> in the Duty.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if the <hi>Acts</hi> had been, That every ſeller of Wine, contrary to the <hi>Act,</hi> ſhould pay the King <hi>Five pounds</hi> for every pint ſold, there <hi>Five pounds</hi> had equally been the King's Duty and Inheritance, as the <hi>Two pence</hi> before; and there had been no reſtraint to ſell, but what was made by payment of ſo great a Duty to the King?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Acts ſo penn'd had equally hindred the ſelling of Wine, as now they do by words, prohibiting ſale upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of <hi>Five pounds;</hi> for in both Caſes the payment of <hi>Five pounds,</hi> whether by Forfeiture or Duty, is that which only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the ſelling.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Laws were the ſame in effect, either way penn'd; and conſequently the Forfeiture of <hi>Five pounds</hi> given, as the Acts ſtand penn'd, is equally the King's <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as if it had been given by way of <hi>Duty.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But it alſo appears by the Statute <hi>27 E. 3. c. 11.</hi> of the Staple for the reaſon therein given, that the <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were to pay their <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to bring their <hi>Cockets</hi> of their payments there to the Staple, leſt otherwiſe they might be doubly charg'd.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> which were paid in <hi>Ireland</hi> before the Goods brought to the Staple, was no cauſe for <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing</hi> with the <hi>Corporation</hi> of <hi>Waterford</hi> for not bringing their <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> to the Staple, according to the <hi>penal Laws</hi> for that purpoſe.

                  <p>For Reſolution of which I muſt make theſe <hi>previous Queſtions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is, If before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to Vſes, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tayl had made a Feoffment in Fee to uſes with <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> to the Feoffees and their Heirs, ſuch <hi>Feoffees,</hi> in a <hi>Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the Reverter,</hi> brought againſt them by the Heirs of the Donor, could have rebutted and barr'd them by the <hi>warranty</hi> of the Tenant in tayl?</p>
                  <p>For if the Feoffees to uſe in ſuch caſe could not have barr'd the Heirs of the Donor before the <hi>Statute</hi> by the <hi>warranty,</hi> it is evident the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> ſince the <hi>Statute,</hi> cannot barr them; for he can have no more power ſince the <hi>Statute,</hi> than the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees to uſe had before the <hi>Statute</hi> by the <hi>warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I put the Caſe before the <hi>Statute,</hi> for clearneſs ſake only; for though ſince the <hi>Statute</hi> there are Feoffees to uſe as before, yet no queſtion can be made upon their <hi>rebutter</hi> by a <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi> becauſe the Eſtate is out of them by the <hi>Statute</hi> as ſoon as it is in them.</p>
                  <p>And as to this, the Caſe in effect is no more than, Whether the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> (which muſt be admitted to be a <hi>Collateral warranty</hi>) deſcending upon the Donor, or his Heirs, will barr him or them of the Reverſion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Queſtion I make, admitting the Heirs of the Donor to be barr'd by the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, is, Whether after the <hi>Statute of Uſes,</hi> the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> can have any benefit of the <hi>warranty</hi> granted to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees to uſe, either by way of <hi>Voucher</hi> or <hi>Rebutter?</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> is not in poſſeſſion in the <hi>per</hi> by the Feoffees, but by the <hi>Statute of Uſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Queſtion is, admitting generally that the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall have benefit of the <hi>warranty</hi> made to the Feoffees to uſe, Whether yet in this Caſe, <hi>Anne</hi> the Tenant being a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuy que uſe,</hi> ſhall have benefit of the <hi>warranty</hi> made to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees? Becauſe neither <hi>William,</hi> the firſt <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> nor his Heir, the laſt <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> in the Caſe could, nor can have any benefit of this <hi>warranty,</hi> becauſe <hi>William,</hi> the firſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:99478:191"/> 
                     <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> nor his Heir, could not, nor can warrant to himſelf; but as to <hi>William</hi> and his Heirs, the <hi>warranty</hi> is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinct.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>And as to the firſt Queſtion, I conceive the Law to be that the warranty of <hi>William,</hi> the Tenant in tayl, deſcending upon <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> the Demandants, his Heirs at Law, is no barr in the <hi>Formedon</hi> in <hi>Reverter</hi> brought by them, as Heirs to <hi>William</hi> their Grandfather, the <hi>Donor,</hi> though it be a <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it is the perſwaſion of many profeſſing the Law, That by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter the ſecond, De donis condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalibus,</hi> the <hi>Lineal warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl ſhall be no barr in a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Deſcender,</hi> but that the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl is at large, as at the <hi>Common Law</hi> unreſtrain'd by that <hi>Statute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon <hi>Section</hi> 712.<note place="margin">Sect. 712.</note> of <hi>Littleton, A lineal warranty doth not bind the right of an Eſtate tayl, for that it is reſtrain'd by the Statute de donis Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus:</hi> And immediately follows, <hi>A lineal warranty and aſſets is a barr of the right in tayl, and is not reſtrain'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the reaſon why the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> with Aſſets, binds the right of the Eſtate tayl, is in no reſpect from the <hi>Statute de donis,</hi> but is by the <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>Statute of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> by which the <hi>warranty</hi> of Tenant by the <hi>Courteſie</hi> barrs not the Heir, for the Lands of his Mother, if the Father leave not <hi>Aſſets</hi> to deſcend in recompence.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it was conceived, after the <hi>Statute de donis</hi> was made. That if <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> left <hi>Aſſets</hi> to deſcend in <hi>Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple,</hi> his <hi>warranty</hi> ſhould bind the right of the Iſſue in tayl by the equity of that <hi>preceding Statute of Gloceſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas if the <hi>Statute of Gloceſter</hi> had not been, the <hi>Lineal warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl had no more bound the right of the Eſtate tayl by the <hi>Statute de donis,</hi> with Aſſets deſcending, than it doth without Aſſets.</p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:99478:192"/>
                  <p>For the better clearing therefore of the Law in the Caſe in queſtion, I ſhall <hi>preparatorily</hi> aſſert ſome few things, and clear what I ſo aſſert, without which the truth of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion I hold, will not appear ſo naked to the <hi>Hearers</hi> as it ſhould.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Aſſ. 1.</note>The firſt is, That at the <hi>Common Law</hi> the diſtinction of a <hi>lineal and collateral warranty</hi> was uſeleſs and unknown: For though what we now call a <hi>Collateral</hi> and a <hi>lineal warranty</hi> might be in <hi>ſpeculation</hi> and <hi>notionable</hi> at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as at this day a <hi>Male warranty,</hi> or a <hi>Female warranty</hi> may be, yet as to any effect in <hi>Law,</hi> there was no difference between a <hi>Lineal warranty</hi> and a <hi>Collateral;</hi> but the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Anceſtor</hi> deſcending upon the Heir, be it the one or the other, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bind. And this, as it is evident in it ſelf, ſo is it by <hi>Littleton,</hi> whoſe words are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Litt. Sect. 697.</note>
                     <hi>Before the Statute of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> all warranties which deſcended to them, who are Heirs to thoſe who made the warranties, were barrs to the ſame Heirs to demand any Lands or Tenements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the warranties, except the warranties which commence by diſſeiſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, if a Queſtion had been at the <hi>Common Law</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether in ſome particular Caſe the <hi>Anceſtors warranty</hi> had bound the Heir? It had been a ſenſleſs Anſwer to ſay it did, or did not, becauſe the <hi>warranty</hi> was <hi>Lineal</hi> or <hi>Collateral,</hi> for thoſe <hi>warranties</hi> were not defined at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> nor of uſe to be defined: But the proper Anſwer had been, That the <hi>warranty</hi> did bind the Heir, becauſe it commenc'd not by diſſeiſin for every <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Anceſtor,</hi> but ſuch deſcending upon the Heir did bind him.</p>
                  <p>So if after the <hi>Statute of Gloceſter,</hi> Tenant by the <hi>Courteſie</hi> had aliened with <hi>warranty,</hi> had it been demanded, if the Heir were barr'd by that <hi>warranty,</hi> it had been an abſurd Anſwer, That he was not, becauſe it was a <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of his Father, without <hi>Aſſets:</hi> For all <hi>Collateral warranties</hi> of the Father were not reſtrained, but his <hi>warranty</hi> in that Caſe which could be no other than <hi>Collateral</hi>) was reſtrained by the <hi>Statute.</hi> Therefore</p>
                  <p>The <hi>adequate</hi> Anſwer had been, That the <hi>Fathers warranty</hi> bound not in that Caſe, without <hi>Aſſets,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Statute of Gloceſter</hi> had ſo reſtrained it.</p>

For that the miſchief complained of, and remedied by the <hi>Statute,</hi> is, That <hi>in omnibus praedictis caſibus</hi> therein recited, <hi>poſt prolem ſuſcitatam habuerunt illi quibus Tenemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſic conditionaliter datum fuit hucuſque poteſtatem alienan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Tenementum ſic datum, &amp; exhaeredandi exitum eorum contra voluntatem Donatoris.</hi> But the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee in tayl</hi> deſcending upon him in the <hi>Remainder,</hi> who regularly claims by <hi>purchaſe</hi> from the <hi>Donor,</hi> and not by <hi>deſcent</hi> from the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee in tayl,</hi> could be no <hi>diſinheriting</hi> of the Iſſue of the <hi>Donee,</hi> claiming by <hi>deſcent</hi> from him, againſt which <hi>diſinheriting</hi> only the <hi>Statute</hi> provides, which is evident by the Writ of <hi>Formedon in the Deſcender,</hi> framed by the <hi>Statute</hi> in behalf of ſuch Iſſue of the <hi>Donee,</hi> whom the <hi>Statute</hi> intends.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Statute</hi> did not provide againſt Inconveniences or Miſchiefs which were not at the time of making the <hi>Statute,</hi> but againſt thoſe which were. But at the making of it there could be no <hi>Remainder in tayl,</hi> becauſe all Eſtates, which are <hi>Eſtates tayl,</hi> ſince the <hi>Statute,</hi> were <hi>Fee-ſimples Conditional</hi> before the <hi>Statute,</hi> upon which a <hi>Remainder</hi> could not be limited.</p>
                  <p>So is Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Statute de Donis, The Formedon in Reverter did lye at Common Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cok. part. 2. f. 336.</note> 
                     <hi>but not a Formedon in Remainder upon an Eſtate tayl, becauſe it was a Fee-ſimple Conditional, whereupon no Remainder could be limited at Common Law, but after the Statute it may be limited upon an Eſtate tayl, in reſpect of the Diviſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Statute</hi> formed a Writ of <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Deſcender</hi> for the new Eſtate tayl created by the <hi>Statute,</hi> and mentions a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Reverter,</hi> as already known in the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;</hi> for the <hi>Donor,</hi> for whom the <hi>Statute</hi> likewiſe intended to provide, but formed or mentioned none for the <hi>Remainder in tayl.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Caſes are common in <hi>Littleton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Litt. Sect. 716, 718, 719.</note> and in many other <hi>Books,</hi> that the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Donee in tayl</hi> is <hi>Collateral</hi> to him in the <hi>Remainder in tayl,</hi> and binds as at the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:99478:193"/>
                  <p>But thence to conclude, That therefore the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> in tayl ſhall barr the <hi>Donor</hi> of his <hi>Reverſion,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> alſo, is a groſs <hi>Non ſequitur;</hi> for the <hi>Donees warranty</hi> doth not therefore barr the <hi>Remainder,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>Collateral warranty,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>Statute de Donis</hi> doth not reſtrain his <hi>warranty</hi> from barring him in the <hi>Remainder,</hi> as hath been clear'd, but leaves it as at <hi>Common Law,</hi> but it doth reſtrain his <hi>warranty</hi> from barring him in the <hi>Reverſion,</hi> as ſhall appear.</p>
                  <p>There is one Caſe in <hi>Littleton</hi> remarkable for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, where the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> is <hi>lineal,</hi> and not <hi>collateral,</hi> to the perſon in <hi>Remainder,</hi> and therefore binds not if the Caſe be Law (as may be juſtly doubted) as <hi>Littleton</hi> is commonly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Litt. Sect. 719.</note>
                     <hi>Land is given to a man, and the heirs males of his body, the Remainder to the heirs females of his body; and the Donee in tayl makes a Feoffment in Fee with warranty, and hath Iſſue a Son and a Daughter, and dieth, this warranty is but a lineal warranty to the Son to demand by a Writ of Formedon in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcender; and alſo it is but lineal to the Daughter to demand the ſame Land by a Writ of Formedon in the Remainder, unleſs the Brother dieth without Iſſue male, becauſe ſhe claimeth as Heir female of the body of her Father engendred. But if her Brother releaſe to the Diſcontinuee with warranty, and after dye without Iſſue, this is a collateral warranty to the daughter, becauſe ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveigh the right which ſhe hath to the Remainder, by any means of deſcent by her brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Here the <hi>warranty</hi> of the Father, <hi>Donee</hi> in tayl, is but <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal</hi> to the <hi>Daughter</hi> in <hi>Remainder</hi> in tayl; But ſhe claims, ſaith the <hi>Book,</hi> her <hi>Remainder</hi> as heir female of the body of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee</hi> in tayl, which differs the Caſe from other perſons in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi> of an <hi>Eſtate tayl:</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> And by the way, in this Caſe Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> though he hath <hi>commented</hi> upon it, hath committed an over-ſight of ſome moment, by uſing a <hi>Copy</hi> that wanted a critical emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For where it is ſaid, <hi>That the warranty of the Father is but lineal to the Daughter, to demand the Land by a Formedon in the Remainder, unleſs the Brother dye without Iſſue-male, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe claims as Heir female of the body of her Father.</hi> By which reading and context the ſenſe muſt be, <hi>That if the Son dye without Iſſue male of his body, then the warranty of the Father is not lineal to the Daughter, cujus contrarium eſt verum,</hi> for ſhe can claim her <hi>Remainder</hi> as heir female of the body of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99478:193"/> and thereby make the Fathers <hi>warranty</hi> lineal to her, but only becauſe her Brother died without Iſſue male.</p>
                  <p>That which deceived Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> to admit this Caſe as he hath printed it, was a deprav'd <hi>French Copy</hi> thus, <hi>Si non frere devyaſt ſans Iſſue male,</hi> which truly read, ſhould be, <hi>Si ſon frere devyaſt;</hi> and the Tranſlation ſhould be, Not unleſs the Brother dye without Iſſue male, but, If her Brother dye <hi>without Iſſue male.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is that his <hi>French Copy</hi> was deprav'd, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>French</hi> of it is, <hi>Si non frere devyaſt ſans Iſſue male,</hi> which is no Language, for that rendred in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is, Vnleſs Brother dye: For it cannot be rendred as he hath done it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Brother dye, without the <hi>French</hi> had been, <hi>Si non le frere devyaſt,</hi> and not <hi>Si non frere devyaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke's</hi> firſt Edition of his <hi>Littleton,</hi> and all the following Editions, are alike falſe in this <hi>Section.</hi> I have an <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>Littleton</hi> in <hi>1604.</hi> ſo deprav'd, which was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> publiſht his; but I have a right <hi>Edition</hi> in <hi>1581.</hi> which it ſeems Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaw not, where the Reading is right, <hi>Si ſon frere devyaſt ſans Iſſue male:</hi> Therefore you may mend all your <hi>Littletons,</hi> if you pleaſe, and in peruſing the Caſe, you will find the groſſneſs of the falſe Copies more clearly than you can by this my Diſcourſe of it.</p>
                  <p>And after all, I much doubt whether this Caſe, as <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is commonly underſtood, that is, <hi>That this lineal warranty doth not bind the Daughter without Aſſets deſcending,</hi> be <hi>Law,</hi> my <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, for that no <hi>Iſſue in tayl</hi> is defended from the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee,</hi> or <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>inherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to the Eſtates intended within that <hi>Statute,</hi> and no Eſtates are ſo intended but ſuch as had been <hi>Fee-ſimples Conditional</hi> at the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And no Eſtate in <hi>Remainder</hi> of an Eſtate tayl, that is of a <hi>Fee Conditional,</hi> could be at <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All <hi>Iſſues in tayl,</hi> within that <hi>Statute,</hi> are to claim by the Writ there purpoſely formed for them, which is a <hi>Formedon in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcender,</hi> not in <hi>Remainder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> A third thing to be cleared, is, That the <hi>Statute de Donis</hi> did not intend to preſerve the <hi>Eſtate tayl</hi> for the Iſſue, or the <hi>Reverſion</hi> for the <hi>Donor</hi> abſolutely againſt all <hi>warranties</hi> that might barr them, but only againſt the <hi>Alienation,</hi> with, or without <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> and <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> only; for if it
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:99478:194"/> had intended otherwiſe, it had reſtrain'd all <hi>Collateral warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> of any other Anceſtor, from binding the <hi>Iſſue in tayl,</hi> which it neither did, nor intended, though well it might, ſuch <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranters</hi> having no title.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> The <hi>Statute de Donis</hi> did not intend to reſtrain the <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of any Eſtates, but <hi>Eſtates of Inheritance</hi> upon Condition expreſſed or implyed, ſuch as were <hi>Fee-ſimples Conditional</hi> at <hi>Common Law;</hi> And therefore if <hi>Tenant for life</hi> aliened with <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> which deſcended upon the <hi>Reverſioner,</hi> ſuch <hi>Alienation</hi> or <hi>Warranty</hi> were not reſtrained by this <hi>Statute,</hi> but left at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Eſtate aliened</hi> was not of <hi>Inheritance</hi> upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> within that <hi>Statute.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe things cleared, I think it will be moſt manifeſt by the <hi>Statute de Donis,</hi> and all ancient Authority, That the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> though it be a <hi>Collateral warranty,</hi> will not barr the <hi>Donor,</hi> or his Heir, of the <hi>Reverſion.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It had then been clear to every underſtanding, That the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> or <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> by the expreſs words of the <hi>Statute,</hi> did neither barr the <hi>Donor,</hi> nor the Iſſue in tayl (for words more expreſs were not inventable to reſtrain the <hi>Donees warranty</hi> from barring them) and then obſerve what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents had been rightly deduc'd from ſuch reſtraint made by the <hi>Statute.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Statute</hi> expreſly reſtrains the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> from barring his Iſſue, whence it follows, That by the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> the Iſſue in tayl is not barr'd by the <hi>Lineal warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> becauſe his <hi>warranty</hi> upon the Iſſue in tayl cannot poſſibly be any other than a <hi>Lineal warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It might be ſaid in like manner, the <hi>Statute de donis</hi> reſtrains the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> from barring the <hi>Donor,</hi> or his <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Reverſion,</hi> the conſequent thence deducible had been, That the <hi>Statute</hi> had reſtrain'd the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of <hi>Tenant in tayl</hi> from barring the <hi>Donor,</hi> or his Heirs; becauſe his <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> falling upon the <hi>Donor,</hi> or his <hi>Heir,</hi> could be no other than a <hi>Collateral warranty.</hi>

                  <p>Then to ſay by the reſtraint of the <hi>Statute,</hi> the <hi>Donees</hi> have not power to alien the Land intayl'd, <hi>quo minus ad exitum il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum remaneat poſt eorum mortem;</hi> but they have power to alien <hi>quo minus ad donatorem revertatur deficiente exitu,</hi> is to make the <hi>Statute</hi> contradictory to it ſelf; which ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non habeant de caetero poteſtatem alienandi quo minus ad exitum illorum remaneat vel ad donatorem, vel ejus haeredes revertatur defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente exitu.</hi>

                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Again, if the <hi>Statute</hi> had provided only for indempnity of the Iſſue in tayl, omitting the <hi>Donor</hi> and his Heirs, by the words, <hi>Non habeant de caetero poteſtatem alienandi quo minus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementum ſic datum ad exitum illorum remaneat poſt obitum eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> The <hi>Donees warranty</hi> had been reſtrain'd (as it is) to barr the Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>And if it had only provided for the <hi>Indempnity</hi> of the <hi>Donor</hi> and his Heirs, omitting the Iſſue, by the words, <hi>Non habeant poteſtatem alienandi quo minus Tenementum ſic datum ad Donato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem vel ad ejus haeredes revertatur deficiente exitu,</hi> muſt not his <hi>warranty</hi> have been reſtrain'd from barring the <hi>Donor</hi> and his Heirs in like manner?</p>
                  <p>Why then the reſtraint reaching to both (Iſſue and Donor) muſt not both have like benefit of it?</p>
                  <p>And for further Anſwer to that <hi>thin</hi> Objection, That the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> did not provide againſt the <hi>Donees warranty,</hi> falling on the <hi>Donor</hi> or his Heirs, becauſe it can fall on them but <hi>ſeldome,</hi> and that Laws provide againſt ills <hi>quae frequentius accidunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, when the words of a <hi>Law</hi> extend not to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience rarely happening, and do to thoſe which often happen, it is good reaſon not to ſtrain the words further than they reach, by ſaying it is <hi>caſus omiſſus,</hi> and that the Law intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>quae frequentius accidunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is no reaſon, when the words of a <hi>Law</hi> do enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an <hi>inconvenience</hi> ſeldom happening, that they ſhould not extend to it as well as if it happened more frequently, becauſe it happens but ſeldom. For,</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:99478:196"/>
                  <p>By that Reaſon, if Lands be given to a man, and the Heirs of his body, his <hi>warranty</hi> ſhould not barr the Iſſue in tayl within the meaning of the <hi>Statute,</hi> becauſe there his <hi>warranty</hi> muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fall upon the <hi>Iſſue in tayl;</hi> but if given to him, and the <hi>Heirs females</hi> of his body, it ſhould barr, becauſe it falls leſs frequently upon ſuch Heir female, which is abſurd.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> The <hi>Statute</hi> further commands, <hi>That the Donors Will be obſerv'd, according to the form of his Gift expreſſed in his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which was that if the <hi>Donee</hi> died without Iſſue, the Land ſhould retorn to the <hi>Donor</hi> or his Heirs. Therefore ſuch alienation is <hi>forbid</hi> which hinders the retorn of it according to the <hi>Charter,</hi> and conſequently alienation with <hi>warranty</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
                  <p>I add, That the makers of the <hi>Statute</hi> well underſtood the uſe of <hi>reſtraining</hi> the <hi>Donees warranty</hi> from hurting the <hi>Donor,</hi> or the Iſſue in tayl, but not <hi>poſſibly</hi> the uſe of reſtraining his <hi>Lineal</hi> or <hi>Collateral warranty,</hi> which were terms then <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and unknown, and therefore not in their proſpect at all.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now a little reſume my former reaſoning, for more clearing of this point.</p>
                  <p>If immediately after the <hi>Statute de Donis,</hi> Tenant in tayl had made a Feoffment in Fee with <hi>warranty,</hi> which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Iſſue in tayl, if it had been demanded, Whether that <hi>warranty</hi> barr'd the Iſſue in a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the <hi>Deſcender,</hi> it had been an unintelligible Anſwer to have ſaid in that Age, That it did not barr the Iſſue in tayl, becauſe it was a <hi>Lineal warranty;</hi> for that had been to anſwer an <hi>Ignotum per multò ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notius,</hi> than which nothing is more irrational.</p>
                  <p>But the clean Anſwer had been, That the <hi>Donees</hi> power of <hi>Alienation</hi> was reſtrained in general by the <hi>Statute de Donis,</hi> and therefore his <hi>Alienation</hi> by <hi>warranty,</hi> and conſequently his <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi> could not barr the Iſſue in tayl.</p>
                  <p>In like manner if Tenant in tayl had been with the <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> over, ſoon after the <hi>Statute</hi> (as then it might be) and he had made a Feoffment in Fee with <hi>warranty,</hi> and dyed, and the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> had deſcended upon him in the Remainder.</p>
                  <p>If it had been <hi>demanded</hi> then, Whether that <hi>warranty</hi> did barr him in the <hi>Remainder?</hi> It had been an Anſwer not to be underſtood to have ſaid, That it did barr him, becauſe it was a <hi>Collateral warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:99478:196"/>
                  <p>But the right Anſwer had been, That it was the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Anceſtor,</hi> deſcending upon the Heir, and was not reſtrained within the <hi>Statute de Donis,</hi> and therefore muſt bind him in the Remainder of <hi>Common Courſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the binding of <hi>Lineal</hi> and <hi>Collateral warranties,</hi> or their not binding, is an <hi>Extraction</hi> out of mens brains, and <hi>Speculations,</hi> many ſcores of years after the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute de Donis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if <hi>Littleton</hi> (whoſe memory I much honour) had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that plain way in reſolving his many excellent Caſes in his Chapter of <hi>warranty,</hi> of ſaying the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor</hi> doth not bind in this Caſe, becauſe it is reſtraind by the <hi>Statute of Gloceſter,</hi> or the <hi>Statute de Donis,</hi> and it doth bind in this Caſe, as at the <hi>Common Law,</hi> becauſe not reſtrain'd by either <hi>Statute</hi> (for when he wrote there were no other <hi>Statutes</hi> reſtraining <hi>warranties,</hi> there is now a third <hi>11 H. 7.</hi>) his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>warranties</hi> had been more clear and ſatisfactory than now it is, being intricated under the <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>Lineal</hi> and <hi>Collateral;</hi> for that in truth is the <hi>genuine Reſolution</hi> of moſt, if not of all his Caſes: For no mans <hi>warranty</hi> doth bind, or not, directly, and a <hi>priori,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Lineal</hi> or <hi>Collateral;</hi> for no <hi>Statute</hi> reſtrains any <hi>warranty</hi> under thoſe terms from binding, nor no Law inſtitutes any <hi>warranty</hi> in thoſe terms; but thoſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints by conſequent only from the reſtraints of <hi>warranties</hi> made by <hi>Statutes.</hi>

                  <p>On the other ſide was urg'd Sir <hi>Edward Coke's</hi> Opinion upon <hi>Sect. 712.</hi> of <hi>Littleton,</hi> and his <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute de Donis</hi> (which is but the quoting of his <hi>Littleton</hi>) where his words are,</p>
                  <p>The <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee in tayl,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cok. Litt. Sect. 712.</note> which is <hi>Collateral</hi> to the <hi>Donor</hi> or him in <hi>Remainder</hi> being heir to him, doth bind them without any <hi>Aſſets:</hi> For though the <hi>Alienation</hi> of the <hi>Donee,</hi> after Iſſue, doth not barr the <hi>Donor</hi> (which was the Miſchief provided for by the <hi>Act</hi>) yet the <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> being <hi>Collateral,</hi> doth barr both of them, becauſe the <hi>Act</hi> reſtrains not that <hi>warranty,</hi> but it remaineth at <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:99478:197"/>
                  <p>Theſe words may have a double meaning, though the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Donee</hi> doth not barr the <hi>Donor</hi> (which was the <hi>Miſchief</hi> provided for by the Act) yet the <hi>warranty</hi> being <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> doth barr.</p>
                  <p>If the meaning be, That the <hi>warranty</hi> is a thing <hi>Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> to the <hi>Alienation</hi> againſt which proviſion was made, and therefore the <hi>warranty</hi> was not reſtrained, but the <hi>Alienation</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame reaſon, and in the ſame words, it may be ſaid, The <hi>Alienation</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> doth not barr the Iſſue in tayl (which was the <hi>Miſchief</hi> provided for by the Act) yet his <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi> which is a thing <hi>Collateral</hi> to the <hi>Alienation,</hi> doth barr, becauſe it remains at <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as this Reaſon concludes equally, That the <hi>Lineal war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> of <hi>Donee</hi> in tayl ſhould barr his iſſue, as that his <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> ſhould barr the <hi>Donor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another meaning of his words may be, having firſt aſſerted that the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> doth barr the <hi>Donor</hi> deſcending upon him, and giving the reaſon of it, he gives no other but this, <hi>For though the Alienation of Donee in tayl doth not barr him, yet the warranty, being a Collateral warran y, doth barr him;</hi> which is <hi>idem per idem,</hi> and the ſame as if he ſaid, <hi>The Collateral warranty of Donee in tayl doth barr the Donor and him in Remainder; for the warranty being Collateral, doth barr both of them;</hi> which is no reaſon of his <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> but the ſame <hi>Aſſertion</hi> over again. And where it follows, For the <hi>Act</hi> reſtraineth not that <hi>warranty, viz.</hi> the <hi>Collateral,</hi> no more doth the <hi>Act</hi> reſtrain the <hi>Lineal warranty</hi> in expreſs terms, or by any <hi>Periphraſis,</hi> more than it doth the <hi>Collateral,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains all power of <hi>Alienation</hi> in prejudice of the Iſſue or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and conſequently the power of <hi>Aliening</hi> with <hi>warranty</hi> to the hurt of either.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond thing objected was <hi>Littleton's</hi> own Authority in the ſame <hi>Sect. 712.</hi> his words are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that demandeth Fee-tayl by Writ of Formedon in Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhall not be barr'd by Lineal Warranty, unleſs he hath Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets by deſcent in Fee-ſimple by the ſame Anceſtor that made the warranty.</hi> But <hi>ſaith</hi> not he that demandeth Fee-tayl by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon in Remainder,</hi> ſhall not be barr'd, <hi>quod nota</hi> as to the Caſe, <hi>Sect. 719. But Collateral warranty is a barr to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Fee, and alſo to him that demandeth Fee-tayl, without any other deſcent of Fee-ſimple.</hi> Whence it was concluded, That
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99478:197"/> the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> muſt barr the <hi>Donor</hi> without Aſſets, who demands a <hi>Fee-ſimple.</hi> But</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Littleton's</hi> words end not there, but immediately follow, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Caſes which are reſtrain'd by the Statutes,</hi> in the plural number; which words taken in, as <hi>Littleton's</hi> Caſe is, make his Authority directly for me.</p>
                  <p>For when <hi>Littleton</hi> wrote, there were but <hi>two Statutes</hi> which reſtrain'd any <hi>warranty</hi> from binding, as at <hi>Common Law,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Statute of Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter the ſecond, de Donis;</hi> now there is a <hi>third, 11 H. 7. c. 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as thoſe words of <hi>Littleton</hi> are the ſame as if he had ſaid, <hi>Except in Caſes reſtrain'd by the Statutes of Gloceſter and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter the ſecond, de Donis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it follows, That by <hi>Littleton</hi> both <hi>Statutes</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ſome <hi>Collateral warranties,</hi> but the <hi>Statute de Donis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains no other than the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon the <hi>Donor,</hi> it leaving all other <hi>Collateral war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties</hi> as at the <hi>Common Law. Ergo</hi> it doth reſtrain that, which is the <hi>ſolution</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and according to <hi>Littleton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have examined ſeveral <hi>Editions</hi> of <hi>Littleton,</hi> and the words are the ſame in all, <hi>Si non in Caſes reſtrained per les Eſtatutes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No man will ſay, that by thoſe words, <hi>Except in Caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Statutes, Littleton</hi> meant <hi>Statutes</hi> that were not then made, nor perhaps never would be.</p>
                  <p>For that were to make him ſay in inſtructing his Son (for, and to whom he writ his <hi>Books</hi>) what the Law was.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> doth bind both for <hi>Fee</hi> and <hi>Fee tayl,</hi> except in Caſes reſtrain'd by <hi>Statutes,</hi> yet to be made, and which perhaps never will be made: Beſides the words <hi>reſtrain'd per les Eſtatutes</hi> by the <hi>Statutes,</hi> always denote <hi>Statutes</hi> which ſignally are, and not which are not.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> The third Objection was from <hi>Littleton, Sect. 716.</hi> where it is ſhewed the <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl doth bind him in <hi>Remainder</hi> in tayl, which is agreed; for the <hi>Statute de Donis</hi> reſtrains not the <hi>warranty</hi> of <hi>Donee</hi> in tayl deſcending upon him in <hi>Remainder,</hi> as hath been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>And for that the name of <hi>Herle</hi> is written in the <hi>Report</hi> in large Letters, as the <hi>Judges</hi> Names uſe to be, it was miſtaken at the <hi>Barr,</hi> as if the Context had begun, <hi>Herle que fuit un Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic dit,</hi> which could not then be an Opinion of <hi>Herles.</hi> For if he were at the making of the <hi>Statute de Donis, 13 E. 1.</hi> he could not then be leſs than <hi>Four and twenty,</hi> or <hi>Five and twenty</hi> years old, and muſt have liv'd after until <hi>41 E. 3.</hi> above <hi>Eighty</hi> years.

                  </p>
                  <p>So it is not <hi>Herle's</hi> Opinion, but <hi>Finchden</hi> ſaith, It is ſaid in Terms, that is, of the <hi>Year Books,</hi> how <hi>Herle,</hi> who was a Iuſtice, ſaid, He was at the making of the <hi>Statute</hi> which was made to redreſs the <hi>Miſchief</hi> to the <hi>Donor,</hi> who was a <hi>ſtranger;</hi> And therefore he ſaid that the <hi>Donor</hi> in the Caſe being no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he ſaw no reaſon why he ſhould not be barr'd, being out of

                  <p>So as Sir <hi>William Herle's</hi> Iudgment, who was then <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> in three ſeveral years, and ſeveral Caſes, was directly contrary to what <hi>Finchden, 41 E. 3.</hi> ſaid it was upon Report.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the contrary of what my Brother <hi>Ellis</hi> urg'd from this Caſe, may be thus inferr'd out of it: This Caſe admits that the <hi>Statute</hi> reſtrains the <hi>warranty</hi> of the <hi>Donee</hi> from bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome <hi>Donor, viz.</hi> a <hi>Donor</hi> ſtranger in <hi>blood,</hi> as was ſaid; for it reſtrains <hi>Alienation</hi> without <hi>warranty</hi> againſt all <hi>Donors,</hi> but the <hi>Statute</hi> did not reſtrain the <hi>Donees warranty</hi> from barring ſuch a <hi>Donor,</hi> for his <hi>warranty</hi> could never deſcend upon a ſtranger, and the <hi>Statute</hi> did not reſtrain a thing which could not be: Therefore, <hi>ex conceſſo,</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> reſtrained the <hi>Donees warranty</hi> from barring the <hi>Donor</hi> of blood to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee.</hi>

                  <p>This Caſe rightly underſtood is not to the purpoſe, for the <hi>Donor</hi> was not rebutted by the <hi>warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl (which is the preſent queſtion) but by the <hi>Donors</hi> own <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Moore f. 96. pl. 239.</note>In <hi>Moore's Reports</hi> this Caſe is, A man ſeis'd of Land, having Iſſue two Sons, devis'd it to his youngeſt Son <hi>in tayl;</hi> and the eldeſt Son died, leaving Iſſue a Son; the youngeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liened in Fee <hi>with warranty,</hi> and died without Iſſue, the Son of the eldeſt being within age: If this <hi>Collateral warranty</hi> ſhall bind the Son within age, without Aſſets, notwithſtanding the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter the ſecond?</hi> was the queſtion?</p>
                  <p>And the Opinions of <hi>Plowden, Bromley Solicitor, Manwood</hi> and <hi>Lovelace,</hi> Serjeants, and of the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Catlin</hi> Chief Iuſtice, were clear, That it is a <hi>Collateral warranty,</hi> and without <hi>Aſſets</hi> did barr, notwithſtanding his Nonage, for that his Entry was taken away. And this was the Caſe of one <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> 12 <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 of the <hi>Queen,</hi> as it was reported to me.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Opinion</hi> makes againſt me, I confeſs, but give it this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Caſe is not reported by Sir <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to him, <hi>non conſtat</hi> in what manner, nor by whom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was no <hi>Judicial Opinion,</hi> for <hi>Plowden, Bromley</hi> Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, two Serjeants, <hi>Manwood</hi> and <hi>Lovelace,</hi> are named for it, as well as <hi>Dyer</hi> and <hi>Catlin,</hi> who were then Chief Iuſtices of the ſeveral Courts, which proves the Opinion not only extra-judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, but not given in any <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The motive of their Opinion was, becauſe the <hi>warranty</hi> was <hi>Collateral,</hi> which is no true reaſon of the binding, or not, of any <hi>warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. An <hi>extra-judicial</hi> Opinion given in, or out of <hi>Court,</hi> is no more than the <hi>Prolatum</hi> or ſaying of him who gives it, nor can be taken for his <hi>Opinion,</hi> unleſs every thing ſpoken at pleaſure, muſt paſs as the ſpeakers Opinion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. An Opinion given in <hi>Court,</hi> if not neceſſary to the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> given of <hi>Record,</hi> but that it might have been as well given if no ſuch, or a contrary, Opinion had been breach'd, is no <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Opinion,</hi> nor more than a <hi>gratis dictum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But an Opinion, though <hi>Erroneous,</hi> concluding to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a <hi>Judicial Opinion,</hi> becauſe delivered under the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Judges Oath,</hi> upon deliberation, which aſſures it is, or was, when delivered, the Opinion of the <hi>Deliverer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:99478:200"/>
                  <p>Yet if a <hi>Court</hi> give <hi>Judgment</hi> judicially, another <hi>Court</hi> is not bound to give like <hi>Judgment,</hi> unleſs it think that <hi>Judgment</hi> firſt given was according to Law.</p>
                  <p>For any <hi>Court</hi> may err, elſe <hi>Errors in Judgment</hi> would not be admitted, nor a Reverſal of them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if a <hi>Judge</hi> conceives a <hi>Judgment</hi> given in another <hi>Court</hi> to be erroneous, he being ſworn to judge according to <hi>Law,</hi> that is, in his own conſcience ought not to give the like <hi>Judgment,</hi> for that were to wrong every man having a like cauſe, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was wrong'd before, much leſs to follow extra-judicial Opinions, unleſs he believes thoſe Opinions are right.</p>
                  <p>The other Caſe is in <hi>Coke,</hi> 5 <hi>Car. Salvin verſus Clerk,</hi> in <hi>Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon a ſpecial Verdict; <hi>Alexander Sidenham</hi> Tenant in tayl to him and the Heirs males of his body, the Reverſion to <hi>John</hi> his eldeſt Brother, made a Leaſe for <hi>three Lives,</hi> warranted by the <hi>Statute of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 28. with <hi>warranty.</hi> And after 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> levies a Fine with <hi>warranty</hi> and proclamations to <hi>Taylor,</hi> and dies without Iſſue male, leaving Iſſue <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter, Mother to the Plaintiffs Leſſor. In 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Leaſe for <hi>Lives</hi> expir'd. In 30 <hi>Eliz. John</hi> the elder Brother died without Iſſue, the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being his Neece and Heir. The Defendant entred, claiming by a Leaſe from <hi>Taylor,</hi> and <hi>Points</hi> entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as Heir to <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A queſtion was mov'd upon a ſuppos'd Caſe, and not in fact within the Caſe, Whether if the <hi>Fine</hi> had not been with procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (as it was) and no <hi>Non-claim</hi> had been in the Caſe (as there was) this <hi>warranty</hi> ſhould make a <hi>diſcontinuance</hi> in Fee, and barr <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it not deſcending upon <hi>John</hi> after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death, but upon <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who is now alſo <hi>John's</hi> Heir, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by <hi>Alexander's</hi> death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Judges</hi> were of opinion, as the <hi>Reporter</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>warranty</hi> did barr <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and conſequently her Heir, becauſe the <hi>Reverſion</hi> was <hi>diſcontinued</hi> by the Eſtate for <hi>Lives,</hi> and a new Fee thereby gain'd, and the <hi>Reverſion</hi> diſplac'd thereby, and the <hi>warranty</hi> was annex'd to that new Fee. But this Caſe is all falſe, and miſ-reported.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For that it ſaith the <hi>Leaſe for Lives</hi> was a <hi>diſcontinuance</hi> of the <hi>Reverſion,</hi> &amp; thereby a new Fee gain'd to <hi>Tenant in tayl,</hi> which he paſſed away by the <hi>Fine</hi> with <hi>warranty,</hi> which could not be; for in the Caſe it appears the <hi>Leaſe</hi> was <hi>warranted</hi> by the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8 and then it could make no <hi>diſcontinuance,</hi> nor no new <hi>Fee</hi> of a <hi>Reverſion</hi> could be gain'd,<note place="margin">40 Eliz. Keen &amp; Copes C. 602. pl. 13.</note> and then no <hi>Eſtate</hi> to which the <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was annex'd, and ſo was it reſolv'd 40 <hi>El. Keen &amp; Copes Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:99478:201"/>2. That <hi>Opinion</hi> was extra-judicial, it being concerning a <hi>point</hi> not in the Caſe, but ſuppos'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Caſe was reſolv'd upon the point of <hi>Non-claim,</hi> and not upon this of the <hi>warranty,</hi> which was not a point in the Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some of the <hi>Judges</hi> therefore ſpoke not to that point, as appears in the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>ſecond Queſtion,</hi> Admitting the <hi>warranty</hi> of Tenant in tayl doth bind the <hi>Donor</hi> and his Heirs, yet in regard the Defendant, Tenant in poſſeſſion, cannot derive the <hi>warranty</hi> to her ſelf, from the Feoffees, as Aſſignee, or otherwiſe, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe may <hi>rebutt</hi> the <hi>Demandants,</hi> or not, by her poſſeſſion only? is the queſtion; and I conceive <hi>ſhe may not,</hi> as this Caſe is.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with thoſe Authorities that make, and are moſt preſs'd againſt me, which is the Authority of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, in the <hi>third Report,</hi> and from thence brought over to his <hi>Littleton, f.</hi> 385. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His words in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, <hi>f.</hi> 63. <hi>a.</hi> are, <hi>He which hath the poſſeſſion of the Land ſhall rebutt the Demandant himſelf, without ſhewing how he came to the poſſeſſion of it; for it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth him to defend his poſſeſſion, and barr the Demandant, and the Demandant cannot recover the Land againſt his own warranty.</hi> And there he cites ſeveral Caſes, as making good this his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame place he ſaith it is adjudg'd, 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 26. <hi>That an Aſſignee ſhall rebutt by force of a warranty made to one and his Heirs only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Doctrine</hi> is transferred to his <hi>Littleton,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>If the warranty be made to a man and his heirs without this word Aſſignes, yet the Aſſignee or any Tenant of the Land may rebutt. And albeit no man ſhall vouch, or have a Warrantia Chartae, either as party Heir or Aſſignee, but in privity of Eſtate, yet any one that is in of another Eſtate, be it by diſſeiſin, abatement, intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, uſurpation, or otherwiſe, ſhall rebutt by force of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, as a thing annex'd to the Land: which ſometimes was doubted in our Books, when as in the Caſes aforeſaid, he that rebutteth claimeth under, and not above the warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall clearly agree, no man ſhall <hi>vouch,</hi> or have a <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Chartae,</hi> who is not in in privity of Eſtate, that is, who hath not the ſame Eſtate, as well as the ſame Land, to which the <hi>warranty</hi> was annexed: And the reaſon is evident, becauſe the Tenant muſt recover if the Land be not defended to him by
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99478:201"/> the <hi>warranter,</hi> ſuch Eſtate as was firſt warranted, and no other, unleſs a Fee be granted with <hi>warranty</hi> only for the life of the Grantee or Grantor, in which Caſe the Grantee, upon voucher, recovers a Fee, though the <hi>warranty</hi> were but for life.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall likewiſe agree the <hi>Law</hi> to be as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith in both places, if his meaning be that the Tenant in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, when he is impleaded, may <hi>rebutt</hi> the Demandant, without ſhewing how he came to the poſſeſſion which he then hath, when impleaded, be it by <hi>diſſiſm, abatement, intruſion,</hi> or any other tortious way: And for the reaſon given in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, That it ſufficeth that the Tenant defend his poſſeſſion: But if his meaning be, that the <hi>Tenant in poſſeſſion</hi> need not ſhew that the <hi>warranty</hi> ever extended to him, or that he hath any right to it, then I muſt deny his <hi>Doctrine</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln Colledge</hi> Caſe, or in <hi>Littleton,</hi> which is but the former there repeated to be Law.</p>
                  <p>For as it is not reaſonable a man ſhould recover that Land which he hath once warranted to me, from me, what title ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have in it at the time when he impleads me.</p>
                  <p>So on the other ſide, it is againſt reaſon I ſhould <hi>warrant</hi> Land to one who never had any right in my <hi>warranty.</hi> And the ſame reaſon is, if a man will be <hi>warranted</hi> by <hi>Rebutter,</hi> he ſhould make it appear how the <hi>warranty</hi> extends to him, as if he will be warranted by <hi>Voucher,</hi> for the difference is no other, than that in the caſe of <hi>Voucher</hi> a ſtranger impleads him in caſe of <hi>Rebutter,</hi> the <hi>Warranter</hi> himſelf impleads him, and in a <hi>Voucher</hi> he muſt make his title appear to be warranted, <hi>Ergo</hi> in a <hi>Rebutter.</hi> But he needs not have like Eſtate in the Land upon a <hi>Rebutter</hi> as upon <hi>Voucher,</hi> which is for the reaſon given of recovering in value.</p>
                  <p>And the only reaſon why the perſon, who is to warrant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleading the <hi>Tenant</hi> of the Land, ſhall not recover, but be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butted</hi> by the <hi>warranty,</hi> is becauſe if he ſhould recover the Land, the Tenant, who is intitled to the <hi>warranty,</hi> muſt recover in <hi>value</hi> from him again, and therefore to avoid Circuit of Action, he ſhall not recover, but be <hi>rebutted</hi> and <hi>barr'd,</hi> as is moſt reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore firſt make it appear by all ancient Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, That the Tenant in poſſeſſion ſhall not <hi>rebutt</hi> the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant by the <hi>warranty,</hi> without he firſt make it appear that the <hi>warranty</hi> did extend to him as Heir or Aſſignee.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But in that very Caſe, when it was replyed, That he was not Tenant by the Aſſignment of <hi>William,</hi> but by diſſeiſin of the Plaintiff, it was not permitted without <hi>traverſing</hi> the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of <hi>William:</hi> For if he were once intitled to the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi> what Eſtate ſoever he had when impleaded, he might <hi>rebutt,</hi> though he could not <hi>vouch.</hi> Which Caſe proves fully both my Poſitions, <hi>That a man cannot rebutt without ſhewing how the warranty extends to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſo doing, he may, whatever Seiſin he hath at that time, be it by Diſſeiſin, or Abatement, &amp;c. or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">22 Aſſ. pl. 88.</note>A third Caſe is, when the Tenant being impleaded, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>warranty</hi> of the Demandants Father to one <hi>A.</hi> and bound him and his Heirs to <hi>warrant</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> his Heirs and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and that he was Aſſignee of <hi>A.</hi> and demanded <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In that Caſe, becauſe he did not plead that he was Aſſignee of <hi>A.</hi> by Deed, the Plea was diſallow'd (which ſince hath been thought not neceſſary) but <hi>à fortiori</hi> if he had plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Aſſignment at all from <hi>A.</hi> by Deed, or without Deed, to intitle him to the <hi>warranty,</hi> his Plea had been neceſſarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed.</p>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:99478:202"/>
                  <p>My next Aſſertion is, That the Tenant in poſſeſſion ſetting forth how the <hi>warranty</hi> extends to him, needs not ſet forth by what Eſtate or Title he is in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>To this I ſhall cite three Books full in the point.<note place="margin">6 E. 3. f. 7. old Edit. new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. 6 E. 3. f. 187 Num. 16. 10 F. 3. f. 42. cited before old Book. 45 E. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in all theſe Caſes it is to be noted, That the Tenant <hi>rebutting,</hi> though he was in poſſeſſion of another Eſtate than that to which the <hi>warranty</hi> was annex'd; yet conſtantly ſhew'd how the <hi>warranty</hi> was deriv'd to him, which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> obſerv'd not, either in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, or his <hi>Littleton,</hi> but cites in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe the Caſe of 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">45 E. 3. f. 18.</note> and ſome others I ſhall mention after, to ſhew a man may <hi>rebutt,</hi> being in of another Eſtate than that which was <hi>warranted,</hi> which is true, but not without intitling himſelf to the <hi>warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Law of <hi>rebutting</hi> ſtands upon the difference I have taken, beſides the Authorities urg'd, will be evident for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>As a <hi>warranty</hi> may be created, ſo may it be determin'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd various ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It may be <hi>releas'd,</hi> as <hi>Littleton</hi> himſelf is <hi>Sect.</hi> 748.</item>
                     <item>2. It may be defeaſanc'd, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> upon that <hi>Sect.</hi> 748.</item>
                     <item>3. It may be loſt by <hi>Attainder, Sect.</hi> 745.</item>
                     <item>4. It may be extinguiſh'd by <hi>Re-feoffment</hi> of the <hi>warranter</hi> or his Heirs, by the <hi>Garrantee</hi> or his Heir.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In all theſe Caſes, if the <hi>warranty</hi> be deſtroy'd, it cannot be <hi>rebutted;</hi> for there cannot be an accident to a thing which is not, and <hi>rebutting</hi> is an <hi>accident</hi> incident to a <hi>warranty:</hi> And therefore if the <hi>warranty</hi> have no being, there can be no <hi>rebutter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then admit <hi>A.</hi> warrants Land to <hi>B.</hi> and his Aſſigns, during the life of <hi>B.</hi> after <hi>B.</hi> releaſes this <hi>warranty</hi> to <hi>A.</hi> and then Aſſigns to <hi>C. C.</hi> is impleaded by <hi>A.</hi> and pleads generally that <hi>A.</hi> warranted to <hi>B.</hi> for his life, and that <hi>B.</hi> is ſtill living, if <hi>C.</hi> could <hi>rebutt A.</hi> by this manner of pleading, without ſhewing when <hi>B.</hi> aſſigned to him, ſo to derive the benefit of the <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to himſelf, <hi>A.</hi> could never have benefit of the <hi>Releaſe</hi> of the <hi>warranty,</hi> becauſe it could not appear whether the <hi>warranty</hi> were releas'd before or after the aſſignment; if before, then the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> is gone, and cannot be <hi>rebutted,</hi> but if after, it may.</p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:99478:203"/>
                  <p>So if <hi>A.</hi> binds him and his Heirs to <hi>warrant</hi> to <hi>B.</hi> his Heirs and Aſſigns, <hi>B.</hi> dyes, his Heir releaſes the <hi>warranty,</hi> and dies, and then the Heir of the Heir aſſigns: The Tenant is implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>A.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he may <hi>rebutt</hi> by his bare poſſeſſion without ſhewing how the <hi>warranty</hi> extended to him, <hi>A.</hi> can have no benefit of his <hi>Releaſe</hi> before any aſſignment was made; for the Demandant cannot be ſuppos'd to know the time of the aſſignment, and conſequently cannot know how to plead the <hi>Releaſe,</hi> until the time of the aſſignment appear, which is moſt conſonant in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Authorities before urg'd.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is, That conſtantly, in elder times, when the <hi>Tenant</hi> pleaded a <hi>warranty</hi> to <hi>rebutt,</hi> he concluded his Plea, that if he were impleaded by a ſtranger, the Demandant was to <hi>warrant</hi> him, which could not be without ſhewing how the <hi>warranty</hi> extended to him; for he was not to <hi>warrant</hi> him, if impleaded by a ſtranger; becauſe he had poſſeſſion of the Land only.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, cites the Book of 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 26. as adjudg'd to prove that the bare poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Land is ſufficient for the Tenant to <hi>rebutt,</hi> for that the Aſſignee may <hi>rebutt</hi> a <hi>warranty</hi> made only to a man and his Heirs: If that were ſo, it were to his purpoſe; but there is no ſuch Caſe in 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 26. but the Caſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 21. and he quotes the <hi>folio</hi> truly in his <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Caſe is not, That an Aſſignee may <hi>rebutt,</hi> or have benefit of a <hi>warranty</hi> made to a man and his Heirs only, but that a <hi>warranty</hi> being made to a man, his Heirs and Aſſigns, the <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the Heir, or the <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the <hi>Aſſignee,</hi> though neither be <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the firſt Grantee of the <hi>warranty,</hi> ſhall have like benefit of the <hi>warranty,</hi> as if he were <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the firſt Grantee, which hath been often reſolv'd in the <hi>old Books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe he cites a Caſe out of 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 4. which doth but remember that of 7. as adjudg'd, That the Aſſignee of Tenant in tayl might <hi>rebutt</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;</hi> whence he infers, as before, that the Tenant in poſſeſſion might <hi>rebutt</hi> without any right to the <hi>warranty:</hi> But the Inference holds not from that Caſe.</p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:99478:203"/>
                  <p>The Caſe of 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was, That Land was given in tayl, and the <hi>Donor</hi> warranted the Land generally to the <hi>Donee,</hi> his Heirs and Aſſigns, the <hi>Donee</hi> made a Feoffment in Fee, and died without Iſſue; and the <hi>Donor</hi> impleading the Feoffee was <hi>rebutted,</hi> becauſe he had warranted the Land to the <hi>Donee,</hi> his Heirs and Aſſigns, and the Feoffee claimed as Aſſignee of the <hi>Donee,</hi> and therefore <hi>rebutted,</hi> not becauſe he had a bare poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But this <hi>Judgment</hi> of 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> denies (and perhaps juſtly) to be <hi>Law</hi> now, becauſe the Eſtate tayl being determin'd to which the <hi>warranty</hi> was firſt annex'd, the whole <hi>warranty</hi> determin'd with it.</p>
                  <p>But however, the Caſe no way proves what it is alledg'd for in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, That a man may <hi>rebutt</hi> without ever ſhewing the <hi>warranty</hi> extended to him, for the Feoffee did in that Caſe ſhew it: So in the Caſe 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 18. the <hi>Feme,</hi> who <hi>rebutted,</hi> ſhew'd ſhe was Grantee of the <hi>warranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this may be added, That what is delivered, as before, in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, is neither conducing to the <hi>Judgment</hi> given in that Caſe, nor is it any Opinion of the <hi>Judges,</hi> but is Sir <hi>Edward Coke's</hi> ſingle Opinion, emergently given, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt clearly in the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude,</p>
                  <p>When the Feoffees were ſeis'd to the uſe of <hi>William Veſcy</hi> for his life, and after to the uſe of the Defendant, his wife, for her life, and after to the uſe of the right Heirs of <hi>William Veſcy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when by Operation of the <hi>Statute of</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the poſſeſſion is brought to theſe uſes, the <hi>warranty</hi> made by <hi>William Veſcy</hi> to the Feoffees and their Heirs, is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>For if before the <hi>Statute</hi> the Feoffees had executed an Eſtate to <hi>William</hi> for life, the <hi>Remainder</hi> to his wife for life, the <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to his right Heirs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>warranty</hi> had been extinguiſh'd by ſuch Execution of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and releas'd in <hi>Law,</hi> for it could be in none but in <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and his Heirs, who could not warrant to himſelf, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By <hi>Littleton Sect.</hi> 743. for his Heirs, in ſuch Caſe, take not by <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> but <hi>Limitation,</hi> becauſe the Freehold was in him with a <hi>Remainder</hi> over to his right Heirs, and ſo hath as great an Eſtate in the <hi>Land</hi> as the Feoffees had, and then the <hi>warranty</hi> is gone by <hi>Littleton.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Litt. Sect. 744.</note>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:99478:204"/>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Statute</hi> executes the poſſeſſion in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the <hi>warranty</hi> is in none, for the time preſent or future, but extinct: If the warranty had been to the Feoffees, their Heirs and Aſſigns, it might have been more colourably que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd, Whether the mean <hi>Remainder</hi> were not an Aſſignee of the Feoffees, and ſo to have benefit of the <hi>warranty;</hi> but the <hi>warranty</hi> being to the Feoffees and their Heirs only, no Eſtate remaining in them, no <hi>Aſſignee</hi> can pretend to the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>William Veſcy</hi> could by no poſſibility ever <hi>warrant</hi> this Eſtate to the Defendant during his life, and <hi>where the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty cannot poſſibly attach the Anceſtor, it ſhall never attach the Heir,</hi> as by <hi>Littleton's</hi> Caſe: If a man deviſeth Lands in Fee to another with <hi>warranty,</hi> for him and his Heirs, his Heirs ſhall not be bound to the <hi>warranty,</hi> becauſe himſelf could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be.</p>
                  <p>And though in that Caſe the Eſtate to be warranted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd after the death of the <hi>Warranter,</hi> and here the <hi>Remainder</hi> to the wife is in being before his death, yet the reaſon differs not; for himſelf could no more warrant this by any poſſibility than that, and his Heir might as equally warrant the Eſtate devis'd, as this.</p>
                  <p>Next <hi>Juſtice Jones</hi> in <hi>Spirt</hi> and <hi>Bences</hi> Caſe, cites a Caſe 7 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſame with this Reſolution, reſolved in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> That the <hi>mediate Remainder</hi> could not be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>In this Caſe, if the Feoffees before the <hi>Statute</hi> had either vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, or by coercion of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> after the death of the firſt <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> for life executed the Eſtate of the mean <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,</hi> ſuch perſon in <hi>Remainder</hi> could have no benefit of the <hi>warranty,</hi> being but an <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the <hi>Feoffees,</hi> becauſe the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi> was only to them and their Heirs.</p>
                  <p>No more can the perſon in <hi>Remainder</hi> here, whoſe Eſtate is executed by the <hi>Statute,</hi> be warranted more than if ſuch Eſtate had been executed by the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are another ſort of perſons who may <hi>rebutt,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>vouch,</hi> who are neither <hi>Heirs</hi> nor <hi>formally Aſſignees</hi> to the <hi>Garrantee,</hi> but have the Eſtate warranted, <hi>diſpoſitione &amp; inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto Legis,</hi> which I conceive not to differ materially, whether they have ſuch Eſtate warranted by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt of this kind I ſhall name,<note place="margin">Aſſ. p. 9. 35</note> is <hi>Tenant</hi> by the <hi>Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> who, as was adjudg'd 35 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> might <hi>rebutt</hi> the <hi>warranty</hi> made to his wives Anceſtor; yet was neither Heir nor <hi>formal Aſſignee</hi> to any to whom the <hi>warranty</hi> was granted; nothing is ſaid in the <hi>Book</hi> concerning his <hi>vouching,</hi> but certainly the wives Heir may be receiv'd to defend his eſtate, if impleaded by a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> who may vouch according to the <hi>warranty,</hi> or may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butt,</hi> as the Caſe of 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 18. is.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It is there agreed, if the <hi>warranty</hi> had <hi>attach'd</hi> the Heir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lords</hi> entry, the Heir had been bound: but <hi>quaere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By that <hi>Book</hi> it ſeems the <hi>Lord,</hi> impleaded by a Stranger, might have <hi>vouch'd</hi> the Heir, if the <hi>warranty</hi> had <hi>attach'd</hi> him before the <hi>Lords</hi> entry.</p>
                  <p>But in this Caſe it appears, the <hi>Lord</hi> was no formal <hi>Aſſignee</hi> of the <hi>Villains,</hi> for this <hi>warranty</hi> muſt be as to an <hi>Aſſignee</hi> (for the Eſtate <hi>warranted</hi> was but for life) and the <hi>Lords</hi> Eſtate was only by order of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Caſe of this nature is, Where the <hi>Anceſtor</hi> granted Lands to a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> with <hi>warranty;</hi> but how far the <hi>warranty</hi> extended, as to the <hi>Heirs,</hi> or <hi>Heirs and Aſſigns</hi> of the <hi>Baſtard,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not in the <hi>Caſe:</hi> the <hi>Baſtard</hi> died without Iſſue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently without Heir, the <hi>L.</hi> by <hi>Eſcheat</hi> entred, upon whom the Heir entred, the <hi>warranty</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtor</hi> having not <hi>attach'd</hi> him before the <hi>Baſtards</hi> death (for it ſeems this was in a Caſe where the Heir might have entred in his Anceſtors life time, &amp; ſo avoided his <hi>warranty,</hi> as in the former caſe of the <hi>L.</hi> of a <hi>Villain</hi>) by the <hi>Book</hi>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:99478:205"/> the <hi>warranty</hi> having not attach'd him during the Baſtards life, the <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>Eſcheat</hi> could have no benefit of it, but if it had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd him, he might; <hi>ut videtur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Caſe, if the <hi>warranty</hi> were to the Baſtard and his Heirs only, it determined, he dying without Iſſue, and then there could be no <hi>Rebutter</hi> or <hi>Voucher</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>Eſcheat,</hi> if the <hi>warranty</hi> had attach'd the Heir; but if it were to him, his Heirs and Aſſigns, then the <hi>Lord,</hi> whoſe title is by the Act and Diſpoſition of the Law, and not as Aſſignee in the <hi>per</hi> had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the benefit of this <hi>warranty; quod nota.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Caſes are mentioned in <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, and in <hi>Spirt</hi> and <hi>Bences</hi> Caſe in <hi>Cr. 1.</hi> and in both places admitted for <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor ſeems this very unreaſonable; That the <hi>warranty</hi> being an incident to the Eſtate warranted, ſhould accompany it where the <hi>Law</hi> diſpos'd the Eſtate and Land warranted to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In many Caſes the <hi>Law</hi> diſpoſing the Eſtate, if the <hi>warranty</hi> attended it not, the diſpoſition made by the <hi>Law</hi> were in vain, for without the <hi>warranty</hi> the Eſtate may be neceſſarily avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Such perſons who come to the Eſtate, <hi>diſpoſitione Legis,</hi> are not properly in, in the <hi>poſt,</hi> but they modally have the Eſtate by conſent, both of the Warranter and Garrantee, becauſe they have it by the <hi>Act of Law, Statute or Common,</hi> to whoſe <hi>diſpoſe</hi> every man is as much conſenting, and more ſolemnly than he is to his own <hi>private Deed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after this way, if the two laſt Caſes be <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> having his Eſtate by operation and appointment of the <hi>Statute of Uſes of</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. may have the benefit of the <hi>warranty</hi> attending the Eſtate, though he be no formal Aſſignee or Heir to the Feoffees to uſe.</p>
                  <p>Many other Eſtates are of this kind; as <hi>Tenant in Dower,</hi> if endowed of all the Land warranted. <hi>An Occupant, Tenants by the Statute of</hi> 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. where the <hi>Feme</hi> conſents to the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher. Tenant by</hi> 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 <hi>P. M.</hi> becauſe the <hi>ward</hi> conſented to her taking away without the <hi>Guardians</hi> conſent. Lands war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, which after become forfeited to the King, or other Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quaere</hi> in the Caſes of 22 <hi>Aſſ. p.</hi> 37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29 <hi>Aſſ. p.</hi> 34. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, notwithſtanding the <hi>warranty</hi> had deſcended upon the Heir, while the Lands were in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Villain</hi> in the firſt Caſe, and of the <hi>Baſtard</hi> in the ſecond Caſe, before any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                  <p>But if after the <hi>warranty</hi> deſcended upon the <hi>Villain</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,</hi> the <hi>Villain</hi> or <hi>Baſtard</hi> had been impleaded by the Heir, and had pleaded the <hi>warranty</hi> againſt the Heir, and had <hi>Judgment</hi> thereupon by way of <hi>Rebutter,</hi> then the <hi>Lords</hi> might have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>Judgment</hi> as <hi>concluſive,</hi> and making the <hi>Villains</hi> Title, or <hi>Baſtard,</hi> good againſt the Heir, and the Heir ſhould never have recover'd againſt the <hi>Lords.</hi> And this ſeems the meaning of the Book 22 <hi>Aſſ. p.</hi> 37. if well conſider'd.

            </p>
            <p>We muſt then look higher, and ſearch for ſurer Premiſſes than thoſe late Awards of the <hi>Courts at Weſtminſter,</hi> to determine this <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt it muſt be agreed, That when <hi>Wales</hi> was a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or <hi>Territory</hi> governed by its own <hi>Laws,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſubject to a Prince peculiar to themſelves immediately, and not to the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> no <hi>Proceſs,</hi> of any nature, could iſſue thither from the <hi>Courts of England,</hi> more than to any other <hi>Forreign Dominion</hi> that is not of the <hi>Dominion of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Aſſertion I neither do, nor need affirm any thing, Whether <hi>Wales</hi> were held from the <hi>Crown of England</hi> by <hi>Feodal Right,</hi> or not? and what ſort of <hi>Liegeance</hi> the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wales,</hi> and from what time, did owe to the <hi>King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> For whatever that was, yet <hi>Wales</hi> was governed by its own <hi>Laws,</hi> and not bound by any <hi>Law</hi> made in <hi>England</hi> to bind them more than <hi>Scotland</hi> was, when yet the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did homage to the King of <hi>England</hi> for that very <hi>Kingdom of Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin then with the time that <hi>Wales</hi> came to be of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> of the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> and was obliged to ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as the <hi>Parliament of England</hi> would enact purpoſely to bind it.</p>
            <p>This was not before the entire ſubmiſſion of <hi>Wales (de alto &amp; baſſo)</hi> as the words of the <hi>Statute of Rutland</hi> are to <hi>King E. 1.</hi> which a little in time preceded the making of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> for <hi>Wales,</hi> called the <hi>Statute of Rutland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it was really a <hi>Statute</hi> by <hi>Parliament,</hi> or conceſſion of the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Charter,</hi> for the future Government of <hi>Wales</hi> is not material (for ſo at leaſt it appears to be).</p>
            <pb n="400" facs="tcp:99478:209"/>
            <p>But by what tranſaction ſoever, either of voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or partly by force of Arms it was effected, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that from that time <hi>Wales</hi> became abſolutely of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Kingdom of England,</hi> and not only of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> of the <hi>King of England,</hi> as it might poſſibly have been, for now <hi>Scotland</hi> is.</p>
            <p>The words of the <hi>Statute of Rutland</hi> are, <hi>Divina Providentia quae in ſui diſpoſitione non fallitur, inter alia ſuae diſpenſationis munera quibus Nos, &amp; Regnum Noſtrum <hi>Angliae</hi> decorari dignata eſt, terram <hi>Walliae</hi> cum incolis ſuis prius nobis jure feodali ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectam, jam ſui gratia in proprietatis noſtrae Domin. obſtaculis quibuſcunque ceſſantibus, totaliter &amp; cum integritate convertir, &amp; coronae regni praed. tanquam partem corporis ejuſdem annexit &amp; univit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as from this time it being of the <hi>Dominions</hi> of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>England</hi> might make <hi>Courts</hi> to bind it; but it was not immediately neceſſary it ſhould, but its former Laws (excepting in point of Soveraignty) might ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or ſuch other as <hi>E. 1.</hi> ſhould conſtitute, to whom they had ſubmitted; and accordingly their <hi>Laws,</hi> after their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> were partly their <hi>Old Laws,</hi> and partly <hi>New,</hi> ordained by him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Preamble Stat. Walliae.</note>
               <hi>Leges &amp; Conſuetudines partium illarum hactenus uſitatas co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram nobis &amp; proceribus Regni noſtri fecimus recitari; quibus diligenter auditis &amp; plenius intellectis, quaſdam illarum de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio procerum praedictorum delevimus, quaſdam permiſimus, &amp; quaſdam correximus, &amp; etiam quaſdam alias adjiciendas &amp; faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endas decrevimus, &amp; eas de caetero in terris Noſtris, in partibus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis perpetua firmitate teneri, &amp; Obſervari volumus in forma ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripta.</hi>

            <p>Then follow the <hi>Ordinances</hi> appointing <hi>Writs Original</hi> and <hi>Judicial,</hi> in many things varying from thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> and a <hi>particular</hi> manner of proceeding, and a particular <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciar</hi> to adminiſter <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>particular Chancery,</hi> out of which the <hi>Writs</hi> for thoſe parts were to iſſue.</p>
            <p>So as though <hi>Wales</hi> became of the <hi>Dominion of England</hi> from that time, yet the <hi>Courts of England</hi> had nothing to do with <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice</hi> there, in other manners than now they have with the <hi>Weſtern Iſlands, Barbadoes, St. Chriſtophers, Mevis, New England,</hi> which are of the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of England,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Iſles of Garnſey and Jerſey</hi> at preſent, all which may be bound by <hi>Laws,</hi> made reſpectively for them by an <hi>Engliſh Parliament:</hi> but all, or moſt of them, at
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:99478:209"/> preſent by <hi>Laws</hi> appointed and made by the <hi>King's Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> and the <hi>King's Writs Original</hi> or <hi>Judicial</hi> from the <hi>Courts of Weſtminſter</hi> go not there; ſo anciently were <hi>Gaſcoign, Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> and <hi>Calais</hi> of the <hi>Dominions of England,</hi> but governed by the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> uſed there, and out of the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Kings Courts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is <hi>obſervable,</hi> That theſe <hi>Territories of France</hi> were not held by the <hi>Crown of England</hi> by that right it had to all <hi>France</hi> (as is much miſtaken) and particularly by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Caſe: For thoſe <hi>Territories,</hi> by an Act and Concluſion of Peace made by <hi>E. 3.</hi> with the <hi>French,</hi> which was ratified by the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> thoſe <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> were then annexed thereby to the <hi>Dominion of the Crown of England;</hi> whereof I had a fair and ancient Copy from Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> but loſt it by the fire.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Gaſcoign, Guyen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 R. 3. f. 12.</note> and <hi>Calais</hi> were of the <hi>Dominions of England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> appears by the <hi>Book 2 R. 3. f. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to all Dominions of <hi>Acquiſition</hi> to the <hi>Crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſome <hi>Writs</hi> out of the <hi>King's Chancery</hi> have conſtantly run.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Caſe,<note place="margin">Calvin's Caſe 7. Rep. f. 20.</note> calleth them <hi>Brevia mandatoria, &amp; non remedialia,</hi> diſtinguiſhing Writs into <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via mandatoria &amp; remedialia, &amp; Brevia mandatoria non remedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi> The firſt ſort, he ſaith, never iſſue into <hi>Dominions</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>England,</hi> but not parts of it; the other do.</p>
            <p>More intelligibly it may be ſaid, That <hi>Writs</hi> in order to the particular Rights and Properties of the <hi>Subject</hi> (which he calls <hi>Brevia mandatoria remedialia</hi>) for this <hi>Writ</hi> is a <hi>Mandate,</hi> iſſue not to <hi>Dominions</hi> that are no part of <hi>England,</hi> but belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: For ſurely, as they have their particular <hi>Laws,</hi> ſo conſequently they muſt have their particular <hi>Mandates</hi> or <hi>Writs</hi> in order to them.</p>
            <p>And though their <hi>Laws</hi> ſhould by accident be the ſame with thoſe of <hi>England,</hi> as hath happened to <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome times, and now to <hi>Wales,</hi> yet the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of them is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily by and under the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Courts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brevia mandatoria, &amp; non remedialia,</hi> are <hi>Writs</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern not the particular Rights or Properties of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> but the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Superintendency</hi> of the King, <hi>Ne quid Reſpublica capiat detrimenti,</hi> ſuch are <hi>Writs for ſafe Conduct,</hi> and <hi>protection, Writs for Apprehenſion of perſons in his Dominions of England, and withdrawing to avoid the Law into other of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99478:210"/> his Dominions,</hi> as he inſtances in <hi>ſuch Writs</hi> to the <hi>Dominions of Gaſcoign, viz.</hi> to the <hi>Major of Bourdeaux,</hi> there to certifie concerning a perſon Outlaw'd in <hi>England,</hi> if he were in <hi>Servitio Regis</hi> there; of like nature are the <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Ne Exeat Regnum, de Leproſo amovendo, de Apoſtata Capiendo, ad quod damnum,</hi> and <hi>Writs</hi> to call perſons thence (as hath been done before they had <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> to the <hi>Parliament of England</hi>).</p>
            <p>And <hi>Writs of Error</hi> into all <hi>Dominions</hi> belonging to <hi>England,</hi> lye upon the ultimate Iudgments there given into the <hi>Kings Courts of England,</hi> to reverſe <hi>Judgments,</hi> or affirm, which is the only <hi>Writ</hi> which concerns <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> between the <hi>Subjects</hi> that lies.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are, Firſt for that without ſuch <hi>Writ,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or permitted to ſuch <hi>inferiour Dominion,</hi> might be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly changed within it ſelf, without the aſſent of the <hi>Dominion Superiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Judgments</hi> might be then given to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or leſſening of the <hi>Superiority,</hi> which cannot be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or to make the <hi>Superiority</hi> to be only of the <hi>King,</hi> not of the <hi>Crown of England</hi> (as <hi>King James once would have it in the Caſe of <hi>Ireland, ex relatione J. Selden mihi,</hi> whom King <hi>James</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in this Queſtion).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The practice hath always been accordingly, as is familiarly known by reverſal or affirmance of <hi>Judgments</hi> given in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> here, which is enough alone to prove the <hi>Law</hi> to be ſo to other ſubordinate <hi>Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">21 H. 7. f. 3.</note>And it is as clear, That <hi>Writs of Error</hi> did lye in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> to reverſe <hi>Judgments</hi> in <hi>Calais</hi> (and the reaſon is alike) <hi>per Curiam,</hi> for which were divers <hi>Preſidents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the ſtate of <hi>Wales,</hi> when it firſt became an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> to the <hi>Dominion of England</hi> under <hi>E. 1.</hi> and when it was far from the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Courts of Juſtice in England,</hi> as before it was added to the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And as other <hi>Dominions</hi> added to it were <hi>7 H. 4. f. 14.</hi> it was queſtioned only, Whether a <hi>Protection, quia moratur in obſequio noſtro in <hi>Wallia,</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="403" facs="tcp:99478:210"/>
            <p>There were two ways by which alteration might be wrought: The firſt by <hi>Act of Parliament in England,</hi> making <hi>Laws</hi> to change either the <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> or both.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, by Alterations made in the <hi>Laws</hi> formerly by him eſtabliſhed by <hi>E. 1.</hi> himſelf, and perhaps by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, <hi>Kings of England,</hi> without <hi>Parliament,</hi> by a Clauſe contained in the Cloſe of that <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Ordinance,</hi> called <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum Walliae,</hi> in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Et ideo vobis Mandamus quod premiſſa de caetero in omnibus obſervetis, ita tantum quod quotiescunque, &amp; quandocunque, &amp; ubicunque nobis placuerit poſſimus predicta Statuta, &amp; eorum par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſingulas declarare, interpretari, addere ſive diminuere pro noſtrae libito voluntatis, prout ſecuritati noſtrae &amp; terrae noſtrae predictae viderimus expediri.</hi> This ſeems to extend <hi>but to the perſon of E. 1.</hi> and not to his <hi>Succeſſors;</hi> and however, no ſuch change was made by Him or his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>But the firſt remarkable Alteration made, ſeems to have been by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and probably in the time of <hi>E. 1.</hi> who reigned long after the <hi>Statute of Wales,</hi> but the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf is no where extant, that I could learn. But great Evidence that ſuch there was, which in ſome meaſure gave a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to the <hi>Kings Courts of England in Wales,</hi> not generally, but over the Lordſhips <hi>Marchers</hi> there.</p>
            <p>This appears clearly by a <hi>Caſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fitz. Aſſ. 18 E. 2. pl. 382.</note> not much noted nor cited by any that I know, to this purpoſe, being out of the printed <hi>Year-Books,</hi> but printed by <hi>Fitz-herbert</hi> out of the Reports he had of <hi>E. 2.</hi> as he had of <hi>E. 1.</hi> and <hi>H. 3.</hi> all which we want wholly, though ſome Copies are extant of <hi>E. 2.</hi> which Caſe is the only light that I know to clear the Queſtion in hand.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And it is repugnant to demand Iuſtice of him whoſe Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is queſtioned, that is, to give it, <hi>ut mihi videtur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That therefore it was ordained by Parliament, when the Baron or Marcher is outed of his Barony in the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> he ought to go to the King for Remedy, and have a Writ in the Kings Chancery directed to the Sheriff of the next Engliſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Sheriff of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſerved the Writ, as being the next Engliſh Sheriff.</hi> This being the moſt material, the other Errors were alſo anſwered, and the <hi>Judgment</hi> was affirmed.</p>
            <p>From this <hi>Caſe</hi> we may learn, and from no other, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, at leaſt with ſo much clearneſs, That the <hi>Summons</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in Wales,</hi> and the tryal of an Iſſue there ariſing, ſhould be by the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of, and in the next adjoyning <hi>Engliſh County,</hi> was firſt ordained by <hi>Parliament,</hi> though the <hi>Act</hi> be not extant now; nor is it conceived how it ſhould be otherwiſe, it being an empty Opinion that it was by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> as is touched in ſeveral Books, who knew the practice, but were ſtrangers to the reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>For if the Law had been, that an Iſſue ariſing out of the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Courts of England,</hi> ſhould be tryed in that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of England</hi> next to the place where the Iſſue did ariſe: not only any Iſſue ariſing in any the <hi>Dominions of England</hi> out of the <hi>Realm,</hi> might be tryed in <hi>England</hi> by that rule, but any Iſſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in any <hi>Forreign parts,</hi> as <hi>France, Holland, Scotland,</hi> or elſewhere, that were not of the <hi>Dominions of England,</hi> might, <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ratione,</hi> be tryed in the <hi>County</hi> next adjoyning, whereof there is no <hi>Veſtigium</hi> for the one or the other, nor ſorts it any way with the rule of the Law.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Accordingly you find the practice was by many ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes remembred, but the <hi>Year-Books</hi> of <hi>E. 2,</hi> being never print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein only that <hi>Statute</hi> is mentioned otherwiſe than in <hi>Fitz-herbert's Abridgment,</hi> and the <hi>Statute</hi> it ſelf not extant, gave occaſion to men <hi>obiter</hi> in the time of <hi>H. 6. &amp; H. 7.</hi> long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſay that ſuch impleading for matters ariſing in <hi>Wales</hi> in the <hi>Courts of England,</hi> and the Tryals to be in the adjacent <hi>Counties,</hi> becauſe they knew not it came to paſs by <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was by the Common Law,</hi> on which had they reflected with ſeriouſneſs, they had found it impoſſible.</p>
            <p>For <hi>that Tryals concerning Lands in Wales, quatenus</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Wales,</hi> after it became of the <hi>Dominion of England,</hi> ſhould by the <hi>Common Law</hi> be differing from other Tryals in <hi>England,</hi> and in the adjacent <hi>Counties,</hi> could not poſſibly be for <hi>Wales,</hi> was made of the <hi>Dominion of England,</hi> within time of memory, <hi>viz. 12 E. 1.</hi> and whatever Tryal was at <hi>Common Law,</hi> muſt be beyond all memory: Therefore no ſuch Tryal for <hi>Land</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> particularly could be by the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains then, That if ſuch were at <hi>Common Law,</hi> it muſt be for <hi>Lands</hi> in all <hi>Dominions of the Acquiſition of England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently for <hi>Ireland, Garnſey,</hi> and <hi>Jerſey, Gaſcoign, Guyen, Calais, Tournay,</hi> as well as <hi>Wales,</hi> but it was never in

            <p>Therefore it is evident, That it was, and it could be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> that <hi>Wales</hi> differed from the other <hi>Dominions,</hi> belonging to <hi>England,</hi> in theſe Tryals.</p>

            <p>So the <hi>Quare Impedits</hi> brought in <hi>England,</hi> and Tryals there had upon them, were not for all <hi>Churches in Wales,</hi> but for <hi>Churches</hi> only within the <hi>Lordſhips Marchers,</hi> whether of the <hi>Kings Patronage,</hi> or others; for there it is certain, according to the reaſon given in the Books, that the <hi>Stewards</hi> of the <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Marchers,</hi> to whomſoever they belonged, could not write to the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And <hi>Newton</hi> was right, <hi>19 H. 6.</hi> That if Action of <hi>Dower</hi> once brought in the <hi>Court</hi> of any <hi>Signiory</hi> real (it ſhould be <hi>Royal</hi>) in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there iſſue ſhould be upon <hi>uſque accouple in loyal Matrimony,</hi> which muſt be tryed by the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but the <hi>Court</hi> had no power to write to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but therefore ſaith he, The <hi>King</hi> ſhall write to the <hi>Marſhal</hi> to remove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord hither, and then we ſhall make <hi>Proceſs</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> But this is againſt the Reſolution of all the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Cr. 2 Car. 1. f. 34.</hi>

            <p>And the reaſon appears in the <hi>Statute,</hi> foraſmuch as the <hi>Counties</hi> or <hi>Shires</hi> of <hi>Brecnock, Radnor, Montgomery,</hi> and <hi>Denbigh</hi> be far diſtant from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Shires</hi> not of ſubſtance to travel out of their Counties to have the <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore enacted, that there ſhall be reſpective <hi>Chanceries</hi> and <hi>Exchequers</hi> in theſe <hi>Counties,</hi> and that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of thoſe <hi>Counties</hi> ſhall make their <hi>Accompts</hi> before the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> there appointed.</p>

            <p>So as ſince this <hi>Statute</hi> the <hi>Courts of Weſtminſter</hi> have leſs <hi>Juriſdiction in Wales</hi> than before; for before they had ſome in all their <hi>Lordſhips Marchers,</hi> which were in no <hi>County,</hi> as by this <hi>Act,</hi> and ſince, they being all reduced into <hi>Counties,</hi> either of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> their <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is abſolute over ſuch of them, as are annexed to <hi>Engliſh Counties,</hi> but none over the reſt.</p>

            <p>But ſince no ſuch <hi>Original</hi> hath iſſued for <hi>real Actions,</hi> nor any ſuch Tryal been.</p>
            <p>And what hath been in <hi>perſonal Actions</hi> of that kind, began upon miſtake, becauſe they found ſome <hi>Originals</hi> iſſued into ſome part of <hi>Wales,</hi> and knew not the true reaſon of it, that it was by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> they then concluded <hi>Originals</hi> might iſſue for any cauſe ariſing into any part of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Tryals to be in the adjacent <hi>Counties</hi> of <hi>England</hi> generally.</p>
            <p>And though that practiſe hath been deſerted ſince the <hi>Statute</hi> of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as to <hi>real Actions,</hi> becauſe the ſubject matter of the <hi>Lordſhips Marchers</hi> was taken away, which in ſome ſenſe was lawful (as is opened) before the <hi>Statute,</hi> yet they have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſtill in <hi>perſonal Actions,</hi> which was never lawful, nor found in any Caſe anciently practiſed, as <hi>real Actions</hi> were, as appears in the Caſe of <hi>Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgan</hi> in the <hi>Commentaries;</hi> yet that was upon a <hi>quo minus</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which I do not ſee how it can change the <hi>Law.</hi>
